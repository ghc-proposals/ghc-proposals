Haskell committee guidelines for respectful communication
=========================================================

Preamble
--------

The GHC Steering Committee has adopted these guidelines for respectful
communication.

We do not seek to impose these guidelines on members of the Haskell community
generally. Rather it is a signal that we seek high standards of discourse in
the Haskell community, and are willing to publicly hold ourselves to that
standard, in the hope that others may voluntarily follow suit.

Motivation
----------

We are motivated to adopt an explicit code of conduct for several reasons

* Diversity and inclusion.  We recognize that the Haskell community, echoing
  the technology industry more generally, skews white and male. We see it as our
  duty and honour to spread the joy of Haskell widely and to broaden the patterns
  of participation, in the hopes that, one day, we will no longer be askew.

* Making an explicit commitment will encourage us to review our messages to see
  if they meet the goals set out here, and will give others some specifics to
  point to if we fail.

Guidelines for respectful communication
---------------------------------------

As members of a Haskell committee, we commit ourselves to a high standard of
public behaviour.  We have one over-arching rule:

**We strive to treat every person with respect.**

Specifically, we aspire to these qualities:

* We treat everyone with courtesy, aware that their diverse backgrounds,
  experiences, goals, and perspectives may be very different to ours.

* In our communication, we consistently honour and affirm the passion,
  professional expertise, and good intentions of others.  Even if we
  occasionally doubt these qualities in someone else, we will not make public
  accusations of incompetence, malice or ulterior motives.

* We strive to be scrupulously polite at all times.  There should be no
  rudeness, name-calling, or harassment in our communication.

* Where we disagree with someone, we avoid forms of expression that might make
  our dialogue partner feel attacked, humiliated, demeaned, or marginalised.
  Our critique should always be of specific statements and claims, never of
  people.

* Disagreement itself is fine: we are enriched by robust technical debate.  But
  we seek to make the tone of that debate to be a conversation among people who
  respect, or even admire, each other.

* Where we disagree, we try to be curious about the perspective, goals,
  motivation, and priorities of the other person.

* We do not tolerate any form of discriminatory language or behaviour towards
  any minority (for example age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex
  characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
  education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
  religion, or sexual identity and orientation).

We seek to apply these standards in all our public interactions in the Haskell
sphere, including email, social media, discussion forums, and so on.

If one of us fails to meet these standards, the ideal course of action is to
write to that person privately, gently drawing attention to their lapse.  If
you're not comfortable with that, please contact the chair of the committee, or
(if the chair is the problem) the vice-chair or co-chair.

Our response should usually be to apologise and stop doing what it was that you
are unhappy about.  Even if we feel we have been misinterpreted or unfairly
accused, the chances are good there was something we could have communicated
better, and an apology is far more likely to bring healing than is a
counter-accusation.

Acknowledgements
----------------

We'd like to thank the communities and projects that established code of
conducts and diversity statements as our inspiration, including these:

* A month before this document was first published, Michael Snoyman proposed
  a `Stack code of conduct
  <https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2018/11/proposal-stack-coc>`_ with a
  motivation similar to ours.
* The `GNU Kind Communication Guidelines
  <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html>`_, published in
  October 2018, also express the positive tone we seek; `Stallmanâ€™s post
  <https://lwn.net/Articles/769167/>`_ explains the intent.
* `Open code of conduct <https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct/blob/gh-pages/index.md>`_
* `Pycon code of conduct <https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md>`_
* `Rust code of conduct <https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html>`_
* `TypeLevel code of conduct <https://typelevel.org/conduct.html>`_
* `Contributor covenant <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/>`_
