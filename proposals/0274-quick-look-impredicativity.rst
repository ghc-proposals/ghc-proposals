``ImpredicativeTypes`` is one of those extensions which are not usually
needed, but is unavoidable once you require it. Alas,
``ImpredicativeTypes`` has been in a half-broken state for many years,
and not officially supported. This proposal describes a new approach to
impredicative type checking which is (1) powerful enough for the most
common use cases, and (2) predictable, so errors can be readily
explained.

This proposal is based on `A quick look at
impredicativity <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-quick-look-at-impredicativity/>`__
(ICFP 2020), which in turn borrows many ideas from `Guarded
impredicative
polymorphism <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guarded-impredicative-polymorphism/>`__
(published in PLDI’18).

Motivation
----------

As most languages based on the Hindley-Damas-Milner typing discipline
do, Haskell 2010 distinguishes between *monomorphic types* such as
``Int -> Int``, which contain no ``forall``\ s, and *type schemes* or
*polymorphic types* like ``forall a. a -> a``. Each expression in a
program must, in principle, be given a *monomorphic* type – if a
variable has a polymorphic type it is *instantiated* beforehand to a
*unification variable*, whose value is found by type inference. For
example, when we write ``id True``, the ``a`` in the type of ``id`` is
instantiated to the type ``Bool``, which means that that specific
occurrence of ``id`` has type ``Bool -> Bool``.

On the other side of the spectrum we find System F, which forms the
basis of GHC Core, in which instantiation is not restricted to
monomorphic types. Using the syntax from ``TypeApplications``, we can
write ``id @(forall a. a -> [a])`` to obtain a function of type
``(forall a. a -> [a]) -> (forall a. a -> [a])``. We say that such
instantiation with a polymorphic type is an *impredicative*
instantiation. System F is able to instantiatiate impredicatively simply
because every instantiation there is *explicit*, as one can witness when
looking at GHC Core.

Historically, the ``ImpredicativeTypes`` extension in GHC has allowed
programmers to use impredicative instantiation. However, there was no
clear specification of how it works or any guarantee that code that
compiles now remains well-typed in the future. As a result, the official
stance is that ``ImpredicativeTypes`` is not supported. The aim of this
proposal is to remedy that, by giving a clear specification of
impredicative polymorphism in the context of the modern GHC compiler.

One may question *why* impredicative instantiation should be supported.
One of such reasons is that there are already packages in the wild which
require this extension, and this proposal gives them a guarantee about
their future support. Each of these packages provide an example of
impredicative types.

Take for example lenses as defined by the ``lens`` library:

.. code:: haskell

   type Lens s t a b = forall f. Functor f => (a -> f b) -> s -> f t
   type Lens' s a = Lens s s a a

Creating a list of such lenses, ``[Lens' a Int]``, requires
impredicatively instantiating the constructors ``(:)`` and ``[]``.
Without no good support for impredicativity, programmers had to resort
to wrapping the values in a ``newtype``. For example, the ``lens``
library defines:

   .. code:: haskell

      type ALens s t a b = LensLike (Pretext (->) a b) s t a b 

   This type can also be used when you need to store a ``Lens`` in a
   container, since it is rank-1.

This proposal makes most of these ``newtype`` wrappers unnecessary.

Furthermore, if we want to replace an lens expression such as ``view l``
with ``view $ l``, we need to instantiate the types of
``($) :: forall a b. (a -> b) -> a -> b`` impredicatively. (Indeed this
case is so common that GHC contains a special, ad-hoc, typing rule for
``($)``).

Proposed Change Specification
-----------------------------

This proposal is structured in two parts. A precise specification can be
found in this `A quick look at
impredicativity <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-quick-look-at-impredicativity/>`__,
to be published at ICFP 2020. Below you can find a more approachable
description, which could ultimately lead to a section in the GHC Users
Guide.

Any programmer who does not enable ``ImpredicativeTypes`` is unaware of
the contents of this proposal: impredicative instantiation is *not*
allowed (rank-n types do not contradict that statement, since there is
no instantiation going on during their type checking). In particular,
type checking an application ``e_0 e_1 ... e_n`` in done in the
following steps:

1. *Infer* the type of ``e_0``, which we shall call ``sigma_0``,
2. Expose the first *n* argument types by instantiating ``sigma_0`` into
   a type of the form ``sigma_1 -> ... -> sigma_n -> sigma_result``,
3. *Check* each argument expression *e_i* against the corresponding type
   ``sigma_i``,
4. If we are in checking mode, run the subtype check (``tcSubType``) of
   ``sigma_result`` against the type being pushed.

For example, suppose we are inferring the type of ``id True``:

1. We infer the type of ``id`` by merely looking up in the environment,
   ``forall a. a -> a``,
2. We expose one argument, and for that we instantiate the type above
   with a new type variable, leading to ``alpha -> alpha``,
3. Now we check the argument ``True`` against ``alpha``:

   a. We infer the type of ``True``, which is ``Bool``,
   b. Steps (2) and (3) are not needed here, since there are no
      arguments,
   c. We perform the subtype check ``alpha <= Bool``, leading to the
      unification ``alpha := Bool``;

4. The result of the inference is ``alpha``; after zonking the result is
   ``Bool``.

When ``ImpredicativeTypes`` is on we introduce an additional step
between (2) and (3), which we call *quick look*. Quick look traverses
the arguments of the application, and tries to infer as much
impredicative instantiations as possible. The results are applied before
step (3), which means that arguments are type checked with the correct
impredicative instantiations. The “quick look” pass only traverses
*simple expressions*, which we define to be (possibly nested)
applications of variables in the environment.

For example, assume these types

::

      head   :: forall p. [p] -> p
      (:)    :: forall p. p -> [p] -> [p]
      single :: forall p. p -> [p]
      id     :: forall a. a->a
      ids    :: [forall a. a->a]

Now consider the calls \* ``head ids``. Because ``head``\ ’s argument
has type ``[p]``, we see that ``head`` must be instantiated with
``forall a. a->a``. We might, more inconveniently, write
``head @(forall a. a->a) ids``.

-  ``(:) id ids``. The type of the first argument of ``(:)`` is a naked
   ``p``, and we cannot from that figure out how to instantiate ``p``.
   But the second argument has type ``[p]`` and, just like ``head`` we
   can see that ``(:)`` must be instantiated at ``(forall a.a->a)``. We
   could write ``(:) @(forall a. a->a) id ids``, but that is much
   clumsier.

-  ``head ((:) id ids)``. To guide the instantiation of ``head`` we take
   a quick look at the argument; but this time the argument is itself an
   application. So we must recursively Quick Look into the argument
   ``((:) id ids)`` to work out its result type (here
   ``[forall a. a->a]``), and use that to decide how to instantiate
   ``head``.

-  ``single id :: [forall a. a->a]``. Here we cannot figure out how to
   instantiate ``single`` from its argument, but we can from its
   *result*.

Generally, Quick Look uses a quick pre-pass to find out when it is
blindingly obvious how to instantiate the call; if it is at all
complicated, we revert to ordinary type inference.

Another way to look at this proposal is that each application is type
checked *twice*: first the “quick look” pass tries to infer
impredicative instantiation, which is then fed to the second, real pass.
(Do not worry about efficiency; in the implementation no work is
duplicated.) For simple expressions it is crystal clear how
impredicative instantiation is threaded. On the contrary, it never looks
at abstractions, pattern matching, ``let``\ s, or any other expression.

One important feature of Haskell’s type system that “quick look” uses is
the invariance of type constructors. In short, the subsumption rules
ensure that if, for example, ``Maybe t`` is a more polymorphic than
``Maybe s``, it must be the case that ``t`` equals ``s``. The proposed
inference algorithm never tries to perform any complicated analysis on
other types: impredicativity must be the *only obvious* solution to make
the program type check (or as we say in the paper, “impredicativity is
never guessed”). Note that since `proposal 287, Simplify
Subsumption <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0287-simplify-subsumption.rst>`__
has been accepted, function types are also considered invariant.

Examples
--------

Several examples can be found in the `A quick look at
impredicativity <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-quick-look-at-impredicativity/>`__.
Let us review the main example, ``(\x -> x) : ids``, where
``ids :: [forall a. a -> a]`` from the eyes of the “approachable”
description.

1. We infer the type of the head of the application,
   ``(:) :: forall a. a -> [a] -> [a]``.
2. We expose two arguments, which leads to the type
   ``alpha -> [alpha] -> [alpha]`` where ``alpha`` is a fresh
   unification variable.
3. Now we do *quick look* by checking the simple expressions against
   those types:

   -  ``\x -> x`` is not simple, so nothing is done.
   -  ``ids :: [forall a. a -> a]`` is checked against ``[alpha]``.
      Since ``alpha`` is under a type constructor different than arrow,
      ``alpha`` *must* be ``forall a. a -> a`` for the expression to
      type check.

4. The result of quick look is thus ``alpha := forall a. a -> a``. This
   means that the second, real type checking phase must check:

   -  ``\x -> x`` against ``forall a. a -> a``,
   -  ``ids`` against ``[forall a. a -> a]``.

Compare this example to ``(\x -> x) : []``. In this case quick look does
not return any impredicativity information (since ``[]`` does not
contain any). Thus the inferred type for that expression is
``[beta -> beta]``, without any impredicative polymorphism.

Effect and Interactions
-----------------------

As discussed several times throughout this proposal, its goal is to give
a clear and simple specification of impredicative instantiation within
GHC. Whereas “simple” is a subjective matter, the availability of a set
of typing rules defines a clear specification.

``TypeApplications``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We deem the interaction with ``TypeApplications`` as a very important
one; the goal is for our specification to benefit from user-written
types as much as possible. We want
``(:) @(forall a. a -> a) (\x -> x) []`` to work, without the need of an
additional type application in ``[]``. The draft paper details the
interaction between those features in depth.

The typing rule for ``($)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, GHC contains a `hard-coded typing rule for
``($)`` <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/blob/795986aaf33e2ffc233836b86a92a77366c91db2/compiler/typecheck/TcExpr.hs#L368-397>`__
which ensures that ``f $ e`` works even when ``($)`` would need to be
impredicatively instantiated. The million dollar question is: can we
drop this special case from the compiler?

Yes, we can. This also means that other combinators such as ``(&)`` or
``(.)`` no longer are second-class with respect to impredicativity.

However, to maintain backward compatibility, we propose to retain the
special behaviour of ``($)`` in one respect: applications of ``($)``
will always be treated as if ``-XImpredicativeTypes`` is on. Why?
Because if not, many existing program (which rely on the magical
treatment of ``($)``, without any extension flags) would suddenly fail
to typecheck. For example, this code compiles today *without
extensions*:

.. code:: haskell

   > import Control.Monad.ST
   > runST $ return 0
   0

If it is to continue to typecheck without extensions, we must switch on
Quick Look for applications of ``($)``. However, rather than a magical
ad-hoc rule, the new treatment of ``($)`` will be fully covered by the
Quick Look specification.

Costs and Drawbacks
-------------------

As discussed below, there is already a branch of GHC in which these
changes have been implemented. Furthermore, we expect maintenance costs
to be low, since “quick look” is a separate phase from the rest of type
checking; there is no intrincate relation between the two phases in the
code.

``ImpredicativeTypes`` has always been an advanced feature of the
language. However, once you arrive at it, programmers often ask
themselves: “what is stopping the compiler from accepting this?”. This
proposal gives an answer to that question, with a succint explanation:
“impredicative is never guessed, it must be obvious from the simple
parts of each application”.

Alternatives
------------

The main alternative is to keep the *status quo*: ``ImpredicativeTypes``
is there, has unspecified behaviour. In a sense, then, GHC could
implement Quick Look anyway, thereby changing ``ImpredicativeTypes``
from one unspecified behavior to another. But it would obviously be much
better to specify the behaviour, and we have a paper that does so, and
an implementation that matches it.

Another possibility is to remove ``ImpredicativeTypes`` altogether. That
would be hard to do becuase, despite its ill-specified behaviour, its
use is not uncommmon. Moreover even using ``TypeApplications`` for
impredicative instantiation requires a weak form of Quick Look. And,
even if that is allowed, using ``TypeApplications`` alone is clumsy and
impredicative instantiation is quite contagious. For example, one might
need to write things like:

.. code:: haskell

   (++) @(forall a. a -> a) ids ([] @(forall a. a -> a))

The dollar rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As discussed above, we propose to switch on Quick Look for applications
of ``($)``, to maintain back-compat. That choice could be changed, but
it would require many libraries to add ``ImpredicativeTypes``.
