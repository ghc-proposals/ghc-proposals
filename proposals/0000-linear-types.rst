Linear Types
============

This proposal introduces a notion of *linear function* to GHC. Linear
functions are regular functions that guarantee that they will use
their argument exactly once. Whether a function ``f`` is linear or not
is called the *multiplicity* of ``f``. We propose a new language
extension, ``-XLinearTypes``. When turned on, the user can enforce
a given multiplicity for ``f`` using a type annotation.

The theory behind this proposal has been fully developed in a peer
reviewed conference publication that will be presented at POPL'18. See
the `extended version of the paper
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756>`_.

Motivation
----------

Haskell, along with a few other languages, heralded the notion of
*type safety* into mainstream programming. That is, *well-typed
programs do not go wrong*. Well-typed programs do sometimes crash, or
fail to terminate, but they do not segfault. Now, the system resources
that these programs manipulate have changing states, need to be
initialized before use and conversely, must be freed in a timely
manner. We want not just type safety in Haskell, but also *resource
safety*. We want well-typed programs that do not go wrong in the sense
that they might still crash, but they do not rewind the state of I/O
resources, these resources are never used before they are initialized,
are guaranteed to be freed by the time control flow exits user defined
scopes, and never used after being freed.

This proposal hits another goal as a side benefit. In Haskell, impure
computations are typically structured as a sequence of steps, be it in
the ``IO`` monad or in ``ST``. The latter in particular serves to
precisely control which effects are possible and the scope within
which they are visible. But using monads to write "locally impure"
computations that still look pure from the outside has an unfortunate
consequence: computations are oversequentialized, making it hard for
the compiler to recover lost opportunities for parallelism.

Linear types enable better solutions to both problems:

1. using types to guarantee resource safety, and
2. using types to control the scope of effects without forcing an
   unnatural sequencing of mutually independent effects.

The following example illustrates both points. Using linear types, we
express a pure API for mutable array construction (the type ``a ->. b``
is the type of linear functions, ``Unrestricted`` is such that
``Unrestricted a ->. b`` is isomorphic to ``a -> b``):

::

  data MArray a
  data Array a
  newMArray :: Int -> (MArray a ->. Unrestricted b) ->. Unrestricted b
  write :: MArray a ->. (Int, a) -> MArray a
  read :: MArray a ->. Int -> (MArray a, Unrestricted a)
  freeze :: MArray a ->. Unrestricted (Array a)

The types in this interface ensure that values of type ``MArray a``
are always *unique* references to a mutable array. As a consequence,
mutations cannot be observed by the context, because references
aliasing each other is ruled out. Referencial transparency is
preserved.

The two main benefits of this API are:

- reads and writes on distinct arrays are not sequenced. This means
  that the compiler is free to reorder them, *e.g.* as an optimisation.
  We could go further and introduce `fork-join parallelism
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork%E2%80%93join_model>`_ primitives
  where disjoint slices can be mutated in parallel, *e.g.* by
  different cores.
- The ``freeze`` function consumes the unique ``MArray`` by turning it
  into a non-unique immutable array. ``freeze`` does not, in fact,
  copy the array, it just changes its (static!) state. In the ``ST``
  implementation of ``MArray``, the primitive is ``unsafeFreeze``
  because it is up to the programmer to promise that they won't ever
  mutate the frozen ``MArray`` again. This shrinks the trusted code
  base. Or to put it another way: the user can now write more
  efficient code even when keeping to safe primitives only.

We argue that linear types have far ranging consequences for the
language. Systems programming with quasi real-time requirements can
often benefit from easing pressure on the GC by taking long-lived
objects out of the GC-managed heap entirely. Fewer long-lived objects
in the heap means faster major collection times, hence shorter GC
pauses. Linear types enable *safe* manual memory management for
long-lived objects.

With linear types, we can write an interface to ``malloc`` and
``free`` as follows:

::

  malloc :: Storable a => a ->. (Ptr a ->. Unrestricted b) ->. Unrestricted b
  read :: Storable a => Ptr a ->. (Ptr a, a)
  free :: Ptr a ->. ()

This interface is safe in the sense that users of this interface get
two strong static guarantees:

1. that all that they allocate will eventually be freed, and
2. that after freeing the associated pointer can never be read.

With these two guarantees in hand, users no longer need to rely on the
GC for managing all resources, hence benefiting from lower tail
latencies and potentially higher throughput, while still getting
freedom from segfaults.

Linear types don't just enable using Haskell for more use cases
(low-latency trading appliances, low-level services in
high-performance scientific computing clusters, etc). Correctly
tracking the lifecycle of I/O resources has been a vexing issue for
many network services. Creating a variant of the BSD socket API that
statically guarantees ordering constraints between API calls becomes
possible without the overhead of heavyweight encodings based *e.g.* on
parameterized monads.

::

  -- We need an variant of the IO monad where actions are linear
  data IOL a
  returnL :: a ->. IOL a
  bindL :: IOL a ->. (a ->. IOL b) ->. IOL b

  -- Definition of sockets
  data State = Unbound | Bound | Listening | Connected
  data Socket (s :: State)
  data SocketAddress

  -- When a (TCP) socket is created it is Unbound.
  socket :: IOL (Socket Unbound)
  -- To bind a socket to a port we take an Unbound socket, and make it
  -- Bound. The type of bindL will ensure that the socket is threaded
  -- through the computation, so that the (Socket Unbound) is not
  -- accessible: we cannot bind a socket twice.
  bind :: Socket Unbound ->. SocketAddress -> IOL (Socket Bound)
  -- A socket must be bound to a port before we start listening
  listen :: Socket Bound->. IOL (Socket Listening)
  -- A socket can accept multiple connection, therefore, the socket is
  -- returned in the same state by accept. A second, bidirectional,
  -- socket representing the connection is also returned. Both have to
  -- be used in a single-threaded fashion.
  accept :: Socket Listening ->. IOL (Socket Listening, Socket Connected)
  connect :: Socket Unbound ->. SocketAddress -> IOL (Socket Connected)
  send :: Socket Connected ->. ByteString -> IOL (Socket Connected, Unrestricted Int)
  receive :: Socket Connected -> IOL (Socket Connected, Unrestricted ByteString)
  close :: ∀s. Socket s -> IOL ()

The `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756>`_ mentions other use
cases as well, such as efficient and safe data serialization as well
as using types to statically enforce interaction protocols between
communicating processes (*e.g.* via RPC calls). GHC users will no
doubt invent many more use cases over time.

Proposed Change Specification
-----------------------------

We introduce a new language extension. Types with a linearity
specification are syntactically legal anywhere in a module if and only
if ``-XLinearTypes`` is turned on.

Definition
~~~~~~~~~~

We say that a function ``f`` is *linear* when ``f u`` is consumed
exactly once implies that ``u`` is *consumed exactly once* (defined
as follows).

- Consuming a value of a data type exactly once means evaluating it to
  head normal form, then consuming its fields exactly once
- Consuming a function exactly once means applying it and consuming
  its result exactly once

The type of linear function from type ``A`` to type ``B`` is written
``A ->. B`` (see syntax below).

Linearity is a strengthening of the contract of the regular function
type ``A -> B``, which will be called the type of *unrestricted*
functions.

Remark: linear function ``f`` can diverge or be called on diverging
data. It may feel weird because ``f`` will not necessarily consume its
argument. But it's alright: the metatheory still works. One can think
of a diverging computation as not consuming its result exactly once,
therefore, it is vacuously true that if ``f u`` is consumed exactly
once, then ``u`` is consumed exactly once.

Polymorphism
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order for linear functions and unrestricted functions not to live
in completely distinct worlds, to avoid code duplication, we
introduce a notion of polymorphism, dubbed *multiplicity polymorphism*,
over whether a function is linear.

A linear function is said to have multiplicity ``1`` while an
unrestricted function is said to have multiplicity ``ω``. Multiplicity
polymorphic functions may have variable multiplicity (see also Syntax below), *e.g.*

::

  map :: (a :p-> b) -> [a] :p-> [b]

without polymorphism we would need two implementations of `map`. With
the exact same code: one for ``p=1`` and one for ``p=ω``. Function
composition is even worse: it takes two multiplicity parameters, hence,
would require four identical implementations:

::

  (.) :: (b :p-> c) -> (a :q-> b) -> a :(p ':* q)-> c

Syntax
~~~~~~

The new primary constructs are: multiplicities and the multiplicity
indexed arrow.

- Multiplicities are a datatype:

  ::

    data Multiplicity
      = Zero
      | One
      | Omega

  In addition, two specially recognised type families:

  ::

    type family (:+) :: Multiplicity -> Multiplicity -> Multiplicity
    type family (:*) :: Multiplicity -> Multiplicity -> Multiplicity

  In the following, for conciseness, we write ``0`` for ``Zero``,
  ``1`` for ``One`` and ``U`` (ASCII) or ``ω`` (Unicode) for
  ``Omega``. See the Formalism section below for the significance of
  ``0``. Note: unification of multiplicities will be performed up to
  the semiring laws for ``(:+)`` and ``(:*)`` (see Specification).
- The multiplicity annotated arrow, for polymorphism, is written
  ``a :p-> b`` (where ``a`` and ``b`` are types and ``p`` is a
  multiplicity). To avoid introducing a new notion of "mixfix"
  operators, we introduce a familly of (infix) type constructors:
  ``(:p->)`` for each multiplicity ``p``. This technically steals
  syntax as ``(:)`` is a valid type operator under the discouraged
  ``-XDataKinds`` syntax. But this should not be a problem in
  practice.

The linear and unrestricted arrows are aliases:

- ``(->)`` is an alias for ``(:'U ->)``
- ``(->.)`` (ASCII syntax) and ``(⊸)`` (Unicode syntax) are aliases
  for ``(:'1 ->)``

Constructors & pattern-matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Constructors of data types defined with the Haskell'98 syntax

::

  data Foo
    = Bar A B
    | Baz C

have linear function types, that is ``Bar :: A ->. B ->. Foo``. This
is true in every module, including those without ``-XLinearTypes``
turned on. This implies that most types in ``base`` (``Maybe``,
``[]``, etc…) have linear constructors. We also make the constructor
of primitive tuples ``(,)`` linear in their arguments.

With the GADT syntax, multiplicity of the arrows is honored:

::

  data Foo2 where
    Bar2 :: A ->. B -> C

then ``Bar2 :: A ->. B -> C``

The definition of consuming a value in a data type exactly once must
be refined to take the multiplicities of fields into account:

- Consuming a value in a datatype exactly once means evaluating it to
  head normal form and consuming its *linear* fields exactly once

When pattern macthing a linear argument, linear fields are introduced
as linear variables, and unrestricted fields as unrestricted
variables:

::

  f :: Foo2 ->. A
  f (Bar2 x y) = x  -- y is unrestricted, hence does not need to be consumed

An exception to this rule is ``newtype`` declarations in GADT syntax:
``newtype``-s' argument must be linear (see Interactions
below). For backward compatibility, we propose, to make unrestricted arrows
``(->)`` in ``newtype``-s be interpreted as linear arrows, and create
a new warning ``unrestricted-newtype`` triggered when this happens.

Base
~~~~

Because linear functions only strengthen the contract of unrestricted
functions, a number of functions of ``base`` can get a more precise
type. However, for pedagogical reason, to prevent linear types from
interfering with newcomers' understanding the ``Prelude``, this
proposal does not modify ``base``. Instead we will release a library
exposing the stronger types for ``base`` functions.

This library will not redefine any type, and instead takes advantage
of the fact that data types, in ``base`` are linear by default to
reuse the same types, hence remain compatible with base.

The only function which will need to change is ``($)`` because its
typing rule is built in the type checker. Ignoring the details about
levity and higher-rank polymorphism in the typing rule, the type
``($)`` will be:

::

  ($) :: (a :p-> b) ⊸ a :p-> b

The precise content of the library is out of scope of this proposal:
future standardisation of library content is the competence of
the CLC.  However the library will also contain convenient types to
work with linear types, with the understanding that when the new types
are standardised in ``base`` the library would re-export them rather
than define them, such as:

::

   data Unrestricted a where
     Unrestricted :: a -> Unrestricted a

Formalism
~~~~~~~~~

So far, we have considered only two multiplicities ``1`` and
``ω``. But the metatheory works with any so-called
sup-semi-lattice-ordered semi-ring of multiplicities. That is: there
is a 0, a 1, a sum and a product with the usual distributivity laws, a
(computable) order compatible with the sum and product, such that each
pair of multiplicities has a (computable) join. Even if there is only
three multiplicities in this proposal, the proposal is structured to
allow future extensions.

None of our examples use ``0``, however, ``0`` turns out to be useful
for implementation of type-checking. Additionally, ``0`` has been used
by `Conor McBride
<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-30936-1_12>`_ to
handle dependent types, which may matter for Dependent Haskell. In
both cases, the use of ``0`` could be seen as an internal use, but
there is no real reason to deny access to the programmer. Hence it is
included in the syntax.

Here is the definition of sum, product and order for this proposal's
multiplicities (in Haskell pseudo-syntax):

::

   0 + x = x
   x + 0 = x
   _ + _ = ω

   0 * _ = 0
   _ * 0 = 0
   1 * x = x
   x * 1 = 1
   ω * ω = ω

   _ ⩽ ω = True
   x ⩽ y = x == y

Note in particular that ``0 ≰ 1`` as arguments with multiplicity ``1``
are consumed exactly once, which doesn't include not being consumed at
all.

Every variable in the environment is annotated with its multiplicity,
which constrains how it can be used. A variable usage is said to be
of multiplicity ``p`` in a term ``u`` if:

- ``p=0`` and ``x`` is not free in ``u``
- ``p=1`` and ``u = x``
- ``p=p1+q*p2`` and ``u = u1 u2`` with ``u1 :: a :q-> b`` and the
  usage of ``x`` in ``u1`` is ``p1``, and in ``u2`` is ``p2``
- ``u = λy. v`` and the usage of ``x`` in ``v`` is ``p``.

A variable's usage is correct if it is smaller than or equal to the
multiplicity annotation of the variable. Incorrect usage results in a
type error.

The multiplicity of a variable introduced by a λ-abstraction is taken
from the surrounding typing information (typically a type annotation
on an equation). For instance

::

  foo :: A :p-> B
  foo x = …  -- x has multiplicity p

The above takes care of the pure λ-calculus part of Haskell. We also
need to consider ``let`` and ``case``.

A ``let`` binding is considered to have an implicit multiplicity
annotation (the annotation is inferred). The variables introduced by a
``let`` bindings with annotation ``p`` all have multiplicity
``p``. And the usage of ``x`` in ``let_p {y1 = u1; … ;yn = un} in v``
(where the ``yi`` are variables) is ``p*q1 + … + p*qn + q`` where the
usage of ``x`` in ``ui`` is ``qi`` and in ``v`` is ``q``.

If a let has recursive binders, then ``p`` must be ``ω``.

A ``case`` expression has an implicity multiplicity annotation, like
``let`` binding. It if often inferred from the type annotation of an
equation. The usage of ``x`` in ``case_p u of { … }`` where the usage
of ``x`` in ``u`` is ``q`` is ``p*q`` plus the *join* of the usage of
``x`` in each branch.

The multiplicity annotation of variables introduced by a pattern depend
on the constructor and on the implicit annotation of the
``case``. Specifically in ``case_p u of {…; C x1 … xn -> …; …}`` Where ``C :: a1 :q1-> … an :qn-> A``,
Then ``xi`` has multiplicity annotation ``p*qi``. For instance

::

  bar :: (a,b) :p-> c
  bar (x,y) = … -- Since (,) :: a ->. b ->. (a,b), x and y have
                -- multiplicity p

The type ``A->.B`` is a strengthening of ``A->B``, but the type
checker doesn't do subtyping. It relies on polymorphism
instead. However, following the definition above, note that

::

  f :: A ->. B

  g :: A -> B
  g = f  -- should not be well-typed
  g x = f x  -- is well-typed

It would be unfortunate if this rule was actually enforced: for instance a linear function in a
library could not be used with ``map`` from base. Which means that
everybody would have to start caring about linearity. Worse: every use
of ``map Just`` would now be untyped. Fortunately, this sort of
opportunity is easily detected and the former definition of ``g`` is
understood as the latter, well-typed, one. It means that is not a
breaking change to strengthen a *first-order* regular arrow ``->``
into a linear ``->.`` in an interface.

An important point to note is that ``case_0`` is meaningless: it makes
it possible to create values dependending on a value which may not
exist at runtime. For instance the length of a list argument with multiplicity
``0``.

::

  -- Wrong!
  badLength :: [a] :'0-> Int
  badLength [] = 0
  badLength (_:l) = 1 + badLength l

  -- Not linear! But well-typed if the above is accepted
  f :: [a] ->. (Int, [a])
  f l = (badLength l, l)

Because we want to allow ``case_p`` for a variable ``p``, This
creates a small complication where variables never stand for ``0``, in
particular type-application of multiplicity variables must prohibit
``0``.

There are unresolved issues regarding inference (see Unresolved
questions below for a more precise description):

- There is no account of multiplicity inference. A better
  understanding would make inference more predictable.
- For ``let`` bindings and ``case`` expressions which are not part of
  an equation, we want to infer the multiplicity annotation. The
  process for this is not yet defined.

Effect and Interactions
-----------------------

A staple of this proposal is that it does not modify Haskell for those
who don't want to use it, or don't know of linear types. Even if an
API exports linear types, they are easy to ignore: just imagine that
the arrows are regular arrows, it will work as expected.

Linear data types are just regular Haskell types, which means it is cheap
to interact with existing libraries. That is, unless there are linear
arrows in argument position. In which case, attempt to use a
non-linear function will raise a linear-type error. The motivating
examples are all like this: they are libraries which require linear
types to work.

There is an unpleasant interaction with ``-XRebindableSyntax``: ``if u
then t else e`` is interpreted as ``ifThenElse u t e``. Unfortunately,
these two constructs have different typing rules when ``t`` and ``e``
have free linear variables. Therefore well-typed linearly typed
programs can stop typing when ``-XRebindableSyntax`` is added.

The meta-theory of linear types in a lazy language fails if we allow
unrestricted ``newtype``-s:

::

  newtype Unrestricted' a where
    Unrestricted' :: a -> Unrestricted' a

Intuitively, this is because forcing a value ``v :: Unrestricted a``
has the consequence of consuming all the resources in the closure of
``v`` making it safe to use the value many times or not at all. But
newtypes convert ``case`` into a cast, hence the closure is never
consumed. So ``newtype`` must not accept non-linear arrow with
``-XLinearTypes``. These are interpreted as linear ``newtype``-s and a
warning is emitted (see Specification above).

Lazy pattern-matching is only allowed for unrestricted (multiplicity
``ω``) patterns: lazy patterns are defined in terms of projections
which only exist in the unrestricted case. For instance

::

  swap' :: (a,b) ->. (b,a)
  swap' ~(x,y) = (y,x)

Means

::
  swap' :: (a,b) ->. (b,a)
  swap' xy = (snd xy, fst xy)

Which is not well-typed in particular since fst is not.

::

  fst :: (a,b) -> a -- resp. snd
  fst (a,_) = a

So ``swap'`` must be given the type ``(a,b) -> (b,a)``.

Unresolved questions:

- It is unknown at this point whether view patterns can be linear
- It is unknown at this point whether ``@`` pattern of the form
  ``x@C _ _`` can be considered linear (it is as much a practical
  question of whether there is a reasonable way to implemet such a
  check as a theoretical question of whether we can justify it).


Costs and Drawbacks
-------------------

Learnability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This proposal tries hard to make the changes invisible to newcomers,
however, if many libraries start adopting it, the new function types
will appear in APIs. They can often be safely ignored, but they can
still be considered distracting.

Development and maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The arrow type constructor is constructed and destructed a lot in
GHC's internals. So there are many places where we have to handle
multiplicities. It is most often straightforward as it consists in
getting a multiplicity variable and pass it to a
function. Nevertheless, it is possible to get it wrong. And type
checker developers will have to be aware of multiplicities to modify
most aspects of type checking.

Linear types also affect Core: Core must handle linear types in order
to ensure that core-to-core passes do not break the linearity
guarantees. The flip side is that all core-to-core passes must make
sure that they do not break linearity. It is possible that some of the
pre-linear-type passes actually do break linearity in some cases (this
has not been acertained, yet).

Unification of multiplicity expressions (as for for instance in the
type of ``(.)`` above) requires some flavour of unification module
associativity and commutativity (AC). Unification modulo AC is
well-understood an relatively easy to implement. But would still be a
non-trivial addition to the type-checker. We may decide that a
simplified fragment is better suited for our use-case that the full
generality of AC.


Alternatives
------------

Syntax of multiplicity-parametric arrow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The proposed mixfix ``a :p-> b`` syntax for the
multiplicity-parametric arrow makes a potentially non-trivial addition
to the parser. So does the proposed type constructor indexed by a
multiplicity ``(:p->)``.

A way to simplify the changes to the parser would be to have the type
constructor be

::

  ARROW :: Multiplicity -> * -> * -- ignoring levity

It would be very inconvenient to use a prefix notation for
multiplicity parametric arrows: we wouldn't want the type of ``map``
to read

::

  map :: ARROW 'U (ARROW p a b) (ARROW p [a] [b])

So we introduce a binary type construction ``WithMult`` (or some
operator syntax). It is a syntax error to use ``WithMult`` anywhere
except to the left of an arrow. And ``WithMult a p -> b`` means
``ARROW p a b``. So that the type of ``map`` becomes:

::

  map :: (a `WithMult` p -> b) -> [a] `WithMult` p -> [b]

Subtyping instead of polymorphism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since ``A ->. B`` is a strengthening of ``A -> B``, it is tempting to
make ``A ->. B`` a subtype of ``A -> B``. But subtyping and polymorphism
don't mesh very well, and would yield a significantly more complex
solution.

In general, subtyping and polymorphism are not comparable, and some
examples will work better with one or the other. Therefore it makes
sense to go for the simplest one.

In this proposal

::

  f :: A ->. B

  g :: A -> B
  g = f

is, in theory, ill-typed. But it would be a problem to reject this
program (especially with all the constructors which have been
converted to linear types). So the type inference mechanism elaborates
this program to the well-typed η-expansion

::

  f :: A ->. B

  g :: A -> B
  g x = f x

No restriction on multiplicity variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of restricting variables and type applications so that
``case_p`` is allowed for a variable ``p``, we can allow arbitrary
variables and disallow, in particular, ``case_p``.

In this case, we would have:

::

   map :: (a :(p+1)-> b) -> [a] :(p+1)-> [b]
   map f [] = []
   map f (a:l) = f a : (map f l)

In practice, under this situation, the type of ``map`` is probably better
written as

::

   map :: forall p a b q. (p ~ q + 1) => (a :p-> b) -> [a] :p-> [b]

In order to play more nicely, for instance, with explicit type
applications.

A benefit is that higher-order functions with no ``case`` such as
``(.)`` are now capable of taking functions with multiplicity ``0`` as
argument.

A variation on the same idea is to introduce a constraint

::

  CaseCompatible :: Multiplicity -> Constraint

which is discharged automatically by the compiler. Variables
implementing this are acceptable in ``case``. So ``map`` would be of
type.

::

  map :: (CaseCompatible p) => (a :p-> b) -> [a] :p-> [b]

This is harder to implement than just reusing ``p~q+1`` as a
constraint, but is more resistant to having more multiplicities than
just 0, 1, and ω, as is currently proposed.

No annotation on case
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of having ``case_p`` we could just have the regular ``case``
(which would correspond to ``case_1`` in this proposal's
formalism). This simplify the implementation of polymorphism as we
can't risk writing ``case_0``.

On the other hand, doing this loses the principle that linear data
types and unrestricted data types are one and the same. And sacrifices
much code reuse.

Unicity instead of linearity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Languages like Clean and Rust have a variant of linear types called
uniqueness, or ownership, typing. This is a dual notion: instead of
functions guaranteeing that they use their argument exactly once, and
no restriction being imposed on the caller, with uniqueness type, the
caller must guarantee that it has a non-aliased reference to a value,
and the function has no restriction.

Where unicity really shines, is for in-place mutation: the ``write``
function can take a regular ``Array`` as an argument, it just needs to
require that it is unique. Freezing is really easy: just drop the
constraint that the ``Array`` is unique, it will never be writable
again.

With linear types, we need to have two types ``MArray`` (guaranteed
unique) and ``Array``, just like in Haskell today. This is fine when
we are freezing one array: just call ``freeze``. But what if we are
freezing a list of arrays? Do we need to ``map freeze``? This is
unfortunate (the problem is even more complicated if we start
considering ``MArray (MArray a)``). It has a feel of ``Coercible``,
but it does feel harder.

On the other hand, other examples work better with linear types, such
as fork-join parallelism. This is why Rust has a notion of so-called
mutable borrowed reference, on which constraints are more akin to
linear types (or rather, affine types, technically).

Overall, uniqueness type system are significantly more complex to
specify and implement than linear types systems such as this
proposal's.

Linearity-in-kinds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of adding a type for linear function, we could classify types
in two kinds: one of unrestricted types and one of linear
types. A value of a linear type must be used in a linear fashion.

This would get rid of the continuation of ``newMArray`` in the
motivating ``MArray`` interface.

The most natural way to do this, in Haskell, is to add a second
parameter to ``TYPE`` (the first one is for levity polymorphism). So,
ignoring the levity polymorphism, we would have ``TYPE '1`` for linear
types and ``TYPE 'U`` for unrestricted type. We get polymorphism by
abstracting over the multiplicity.

As interesting as it is, there is quite some complication associated
to it. First, because of laziness, you can't have a function of type
``(A :: TYPE '1) -> (B :: TYPE 'U)`` (because you don't need to
consume the result, hence you may not consume an argument that you
have to consume). So what would be the type of the arrow? Something
like ``forall (p :: Multiplicity) (q ⩽ p). p -> q -> q``. So we're
introducing some kind of bounded polymorphism in our story. This is
quite a bit harder than our proposal.

Most types will live in both kinds, but that would have to be
explicit:

::

  data List (p :: Multiplicity) (a :: TYPE p) :: TYPE p where
    [] :: List p a
    (:) :: a -> List p a -> List p a

Mixing non-linear and linear lists (*e.g.* with ``(++)``) would
require either some subtyping from ``List 'U a`` to ``List '1 a`` (but
as discussed above, subptyping in presence of polymorphism quickly
becomes hairy) or some conversion function.

It it worth taking into account that the issues with ``MArray`` and
``Array`` (which may be ``Array '1`` and ``Array 'U`` in this case)
above are not solved by such a situation. Unless there is a subptyping
relation from ``Array 'U`` from ``Array '1``, which cannot be performed
by an explicit function since this would be equivalent to the
proposal's situation.

On the other hand, the CPS interface to ``newMArray`` delimits a scope
in which the array lives. This gives a perfect opportunity to put
clean-up code to react to exceptions. So it may not be such a bad thing
after all.

So linearity in kind seem to add a lot of complication for very little
gain.

On the matter of dependent Haskell, to the best our knowledge, the only
presentations of dependent types with linearity-in-kinds disallow
linear types as arguments of dependent functions.

Future extensions (not part of this proposal)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Something that hasn't been touched up by this proposal is the idea of
declaring toplevel linear binders

::

  module Foo where
  token ::('1) A  -- made up syntax

Here ``token`` would have be consumed exactly once by the program,
this property is a link-time property. This generalised the
``RealWorld`` token which is currently magically inserted in the
``main`` function (the existence of which is checked at link time).

This would allow libraries to abstract on ``main`` or to provide their
own linearly-threaded token.

Unresolved questions
--------------------

Inference
~~~~~~~~~

- There is no systematic account of type inference. Can it be made
  predictable when a type annotation is required? For compatibility
  reasons, we want to infer unrestricted arrows conservatively, but
  experience shows that it can result in very surprising type errors.

- In the formalism, case expressions are indexed by a multiplicity:
  ``case_p`` (and similarly ``let_p``). In the surface language, we
  can deduce the multiplicity in equations when their is a type
  annotation.

  ::

    fst :: (a,b) -> a
    fst (a,_) = a    -- this is inferred as a case_ω

    swap :: (a,b) ->. (b,a)
    swap (a,b) = (b,a)   -- this is inferred as a case_1

  But what of explicit ``case`` and ``let`` in the surface language? We
  can annotate them with a multiplicity, but it is generally clear from
  the context which multiplicity is meant. So the multiplicity
  annotation really ought to be inferred. The general idea is: if
  their is any linear variable in the scrutinee, then the case must be
  linear, and if there are only unrestricted variables, it can be
  unrestricted. Is it sound to always pick the highest possible value ?
  What if there are multiplicities with variable multiplicity ?

Syntax
~~~~~~

Linear monads, like ``IOL`` in the socket motivating example will
require the ``do`` notation to feel native and be comfortable to
use. There is a facility to do this ``-XRebindableSyntax`` but,
besides the problem with ``itThenElse`` mentionned above, this has a
much too coarse grain behaviour: realistically, the same file will
want to mention regular monads and linear monads (there is also
another useful type of monads where multiplicity can change), but
``-XRebindableSyntax`` changes the meaning of ``do`` globally. A
solution would be to have a locally-rebindable ``do`` syntax such as
is attempted in `this proposal
<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/78>`_.

Core
~~~~

In Core, ``case`` is of the form ``case u as x of { <alternatives> }``
where ``x`` represents the head normal form of ``u``. It is used by
the compiler in some Core to Core passes. It is also how default
alternatives of a case are implemented:

::

  fmap' :: (a -> a) -> Maybe a -> Maybe a
  fmap' (Just x) = Just (f x)
  fmap' y = y

is elaborated into

::

  \f o -> case_ω o as y of { Just x -> Just (f x) ; WILDCARD -> y }

But it is not obvious what to do for linear cases. The following is a
linearity violation as ``y`` in a sense contains ``x`` (basically, you
could define a function ``a ->. (a,a)`` generically with this).

::

  case_1 o as y of { Just x -> Just (x,y) }

So we need a simple story (Core needs to stay fairly simple) for the
``as`` clause of linear cases.

The easiest thing to do would be to type ``case_p u as y of { … }`` as
``let_p y = u in case y of { … }``. But this may not be a good idea:
it would prevent default cases, or legitimate patterns such as
``x@(Just _)`` from being considered linear. It may also make some
compiler passes harder than they ought to.

After all, there is a transformation for ``x@(Just _) -> u`` which
makes is a linear program: ``Just y -> let_1 x = Just y in u``. And
the latter program has precisely the same behaviour.

It is not known at this point whether the simpler typing rule would be
an obstacle or whether it is worth it to have a more fine-grained
typing.

Solving this will have user-facing implications, in particular regarding
which view patterns and ``@``-patterns are available in linear
functions.

Implementation Plan
-------------------

- @aspiwack will implement the proposal
- @aspiwack will implement and release a library exporting standard
  functions and types for linearly typed programs.
