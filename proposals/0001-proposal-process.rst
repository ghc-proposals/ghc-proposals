A Proposal for Proposals
========================


.. sectnum::

Recently there has been a growing feeling within the Haskell community that the
mechanisms for proposing features and changes to GHC and the language that it
compiles are less than approachable. In particular our tools for managing the
proposal specifications and surrounding discussions make participation harder
than necessary. Over the last few weeks I have been looking at how other
open-source compiler projects address these issues (focusing on LLVM, Python,
and Rust) with an eye towards improving GHC's own practices.

To be clear, the process discussed below only affects proposal of the following
five classes,

* A syntactic change to GHC Haskell (e.g. the various ``ShortImports``
  `proposals <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/10478>`_, ``do``
  `expressions <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/10843>`_ without ``$``)

* A major change to the user-visible behaviour of the compiler (e.g. the recent
  `change <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/11762>`_ in super-class
  solving, and ``-Wall`` `behavior <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/11370>`_)

* The addition of major features to the compiler (e.g. ``-XTypeInType``, GHCi
  `commands <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/10874>`_,
  `type-indexed <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/typeable>`_
  ``Typeable`` representations)

* The removal of major features from the compiler

* Meta-proposals that affect the way that contributors to GHC do their business,
  such as this proposal itself

Note that this process does not cover,

* *Bug fixes to GHC that do not imply major semantic changes*: There is little
  benefit for these to be treated with a formal process; existing code review
  processes are quite sufficient.

* *Changes to the Haskell Report*: Language standardization has rather different
  needs from the more exploratory proposals which GHC often entertains. Language
  standards are formal specifications which only describes very well-understood
  features; consequently the revision duration is significantly longer than the
  typical GHC feature proposal. For this reason, it makes sense to keep
  responsibility over standardization where it lies currently, with the Haskell
  Prime Committee.

* *Changes to the core libraries*: While there is often significant overlap
  between language design and library design, we are going to declare this out
  of scope for the time being.

Motivation
----------

Let's start by examining a few of the shortcomings of GHC's current
change management processes,

1. Higher than necessary barrier-to-entry.

   Involving oneself in the proposal process requires following a ticket,
   a Wiki page, one or more mailing list threads, and possibly Phabricator,
   each of which requires a separate account

2. The proposal itself and the discussion surrounding it are quite decoupled.

   The proposal specification itself is kept on the Wiki, design
   discussion occurs in largely independent tickets, and further
   discussion is fragmented across several mailing lists, Reddit, and IRC. This
   leads to repetitive and often difficult-to-follow discussions.

3. The phases of the lifecycle of a proposal are not clearly defined.

   This leads to unfortunate cases like that of ``ShortImports``, where
   discussion proceeds for too long without a concrete specification. This
   drains effort from both the author of the proposal and those discussing it.

4. The process that exists isn't always consistently applied.

   While this arguably has improved in recent years, there are cases where
   features have been added without a formal specification or perhaps less
   discussion than would be desired.


Proposed change
---------------

I propose that we adopt a variant on the
`Rust RFC scheme <https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#what-the-process-is>`_,
building our proposal process on top of existing code review tools for
dissemination and refinement of proposals with a standing committee acting as
the final arbiter of proposal acceptance.

To ensure that the process is as accessible and convenient as possible, I
propose that we build this process on top of GitHub.

Proposal process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each proposal goes through the following stages:

1. The process begins with the opening of a pull request to the GHC proposals
   repository, proposing the merge of a document (derived from a
   `provided template <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0000-template.rst>`_)
   specifying the proposed change. This document is the primary specification
   of the feature and takes the place of the current Wiki document.

   Due to GitHub's in-place editing feature (the pencil icon visible when viewing
   a file on GitHub), proposals can be made quickly without manual forking
   or cloning.

2. Community members (including members of the proposal committee) will discuss
   the proposal. The submitter is responsible for amending the specification to
   account for collected comments. It should be expected that the proposal will
   change during this process, which may last from days to months.

3. When the author feels that the proposal is complete, and not being improved
   by further discussion, they can submit the proposal to the proposal committee
   for a decision.

4. Within two (exceptionally three) weeks the committee will arrive at a
   consensus as to whether the proposal in its submitted form meets a set of
   criteria for inclusion (see below) while weighing the opinions expressed by
   the community.

   If the proposal is rejected then it will be sent back to the submitter along
   with a rationale (referencing the criteria defined below). This is by no
   means a final decision; the submitter may at any time amend and re-submit the
   proposal to address the concerns of the committee.

5. When the proposal is accepted the pull request will be merged and the
   document will be preserved in the proposals repository as a permanent
   specification for the feature.

6. The author will create a ticket linking to the proposal to
   provide a place track the progress of the implementation.

7. The author may choose to implement the proposal after acceptance, but she is
   under no obligation to do so. (Of course, neither is anyone else.)

8. During implementation, it is very likely that the specification will be refined.
   The implementor should keep the specification up to date over the course of
   the implementation.

Since the proposal pages already existing on the `Wiki
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/wikis/proposal>`_ represent a significant
amount of effort and knowledge, we'll make an effort to import those which have
been implemented into the proposals repository if this scheme is adopted.

GHC Committee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process involves forming a small group which is responsible for
deciding whether proposed changes should be accepted after discussion
within the community.

The committee should be large enough to reflect the diversity of GHC's
contributor- and user-base but small enough to ensure a sense of individual
responsibility among its members. A size of six to eight members would likely be
a good starting point.

To simplify the committee selection process, I propose that the committee is
chosen as follows. We seek nominations (including self-nominations); and then
Simon Peyton-Jones and Simon Marlow select members from those nominations. This
is simple and clear. It is also not very democratic, but Simon & Simon did
originate GHC, and it is far from clear that a voting process would yield a
better result. Moreover, voting brings with it a number of additional
complexities (e.g. who can vote? who decides who can vote? how are votes
collected?)

The group will have three roles,

* *Deciding proposal acceptance.* At the proposal author's invitation, the
  committee makes the decision over whether a proposal should be accepted, in
  light of a set of defined criteria (see below).

* *Judging whether the proposal process should be applied.* There will no doubt
  be proposals where it is unclear whether the burden of the proposal process is
  necessary. The responsibility for determining the scope of the process lies
  with the committee.

* *Ensuring that the process is applied when necessary.* The committee will be
  expected to monitor GHC contributions and ensure that changes which fall
  within the scope of the proposal process indeed go through the process.

Criteria for new features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The committee is responsible for weighing a variety of factors when deciding
whether to adopt a feature. These are all judgement calls.

1. *The problem*. What exactly is the problem that the feature solves? Is
   it an important problem, felt by many users, or is it very specialised?

2. *The right solution; generality*. Elegance, economy, and generality are
   important. Sometimes a problem has lots of solutions, none of which have that
   "aha" feeling of "this is the Right way to solve this". A classic example is
   that of records, for which we have had endless proposals (including many from
   the GHC authors themselves) none of which felt "right", and none of which
   made it into GHC.

3. *Fit with the language*. If we just throw things into GHC willy-nilly, it
   will become a large ball of incoherent and inconsistent mud. We strive to add
   features that are consistent with the rest of the language.

4. *Specification cost*. Does the benefit of the feature justify the extra
   complexity in the language specification? Does the new feature interact
   awkwardly with existing features, or does it enhance them? How easy is it for
   users to understand the new feature?

5. *Implementation cost*. How complex is the implementation likely to be? Is it
   highly localised, or does it require pervasive changes? As an author and
   contributor, it may look like you are giving GHC free work, but this
   viewpoint doesn't align with the reality of a large project with a timescale
   in decades. Writing code is cheap; maintaining it is expensive.


Drawbacks
---------

Of course, group decision-making processes are difficult to manage and tools
will only bring you so far. While the Rust scheme does seem to function more
smoothly than our current system, it is not free of issues (as most recently
discussed by `Aaron Turon
<https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/07/05/rfc-refinement/>`_). These issues will
likely apply to the process proposed here as well. In particular,

* GitHub discussions in particular don't scale terribly well; the lack of
  hierarchical threading means that long threads can become difficult to follow;
  experience suggests that Phabricator seems to be a bit better but long
  technical discussions are a challenge for nearly any tool.

* The ease of commenting may bring a slightly diminished signal-to-noise ratio
  in collected feedback, particularly on easily bike-shedded topics.

Moreover, even leaving behind our current system incurs somewhat of a cost.
GitLab already exists and a significant fraction of GHC developers are already
quite comfortable with it. The fact that we already use it for Wiki and ticket
tracking means that cross-referencing between proposals, tickets, and the Wiki
is trivial. Any replacement system would almost certainly regress in this area.

Alternatives
------------

There are a few alternatives which are worth considering,

* We continue to build on GitLab, but attempt to be more rigorous with our
  current protocol. Namely we attempt to better document and more consistently
  enforce the procedures we currently have.

* Adopting the process discussed above but replacing GitHub with Phabricator.
  This would offer the disadvantage of being slightly harder for casual
  contributors. Moreover, Phabricator lacks some of GitHub's support for
  formatting markup. Phabricator, however, offers the advantage of integrating
  better with GHC's current GitLab instance and avoid adding yet another tool to
  the GHC developer's toolchain.

* Adopting the process discussed above but replacing GitHub with GitLab. GitLab
  has many of the features of GitHub but with the advantage of being open-source
  and self-hostable. Unfortunately it would mean introducing yet another tool
  into the GHC developer's toolbelt and add yet another piece of infrastructure
  to administer.

* We move to something closer to the Python PEP scheme. Here a committee is
  formed for each proposal; the committee is responsible for crafting and
  collecting feedback on the proposal. The final acceptance decision is made by
  the Benevolant Dictator for Life. Discussion can be carried out on a medium
  of the committee's choosing, with a common choice being a specially-created
  mailing list.

* The Rust community has been `considering
  <https://aturon.github.io/blog/2016/07/05/rfc-refinement/>`_ breaking their
  process up in multiple stages to make their proposal queue more manageable. To
  first order these stages are,

  1. form a consensus around the problem and the need to solve it
  2. propose and refine possible solutions
  3. choose from among the proposed solutions

  The separation of step (1) from the others gives the community a means of
  concentrating focus on a set of small problems and encouraging exploration
  down multiple solution avenues. The cost of this is that it may frustrate
  authors with a slower, more involved process.

* Something else entirely...


Moving closer to the Rust process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also, there are a few facets of the Rust process which the proposed process does
not carry over for a variety of reasons:

* *Shepherds*. In the Rust process each submitted proposal is assigned a
  shepherd. This is a trusted core developer who is charged with keeping the
  proposal moving through the process. At the moment GHC arguably lacks the
  contributor pool to guarantee this.

* *Final comment period*. The Rust process defines a portion of the proposal
  lifecycle known as the "final comment period". This is a (typically one-week)
  period directly before the responsible sub-team makes its decision which is
  widely announced to solicit final comments from the community. This period is
  omitted from the process described above; instead it is up to the proposal
  submitter to ensure that sufficient discussion is solicited.

Open Questions
--------------

There are still questions regarding the desired scope of the process. While we
want to ensure that changes which affect the user-facing aspects of the compiler
are well-considered, we certainly don't want the process to become unduly
burdensome. This is a careful balance which will require care to maintain moving
forward.
