Motivation
----------

The `GHC20xx process proposal <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0372-ghc-extensions.rst#motivation>`_ motivates why we feel the need for ``GHC20xx`` language editions in general.

The first edition, ``GHC2021``, is now three years old, and I propose we define
``GHC2024`` now, even if turns out to be a modest change, to keep the process alive.

Proposed Change Specification
-----------------------------

The ``GHC2024`` language extensions set comprises of all language extensions
that ``GHC2021`` comprises (`official list <https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/exts/control.html#extension-GHC2021>`_), plus the following

* `DataKinds`_
* `DerivingStrategies`_
* `DisambiguateRecordFields`_
* `ExplicitNamespaces`_
* `GADTs`_ (and the implied `MonoLocalBinds`_)
* `LambdaCase`_
* `RoleAnnotations`_

Why GHC2024 in the first place
------------------------------
There were concerns that defining ``GHC2024`` is too soon, given that
``GHC2021`` has hardly reached the target audience, and that this introduces
instability.

I believe that neither are good reasons to not define ``GHC2024``:

* There is an inherent latency between defining language editions and them reaching the users. It reaches users who do not have to worry about supporting older GHC first, and thus library authors later. This is somewhat unavoidable, but not per se a reason to reduce the frequency.

* Relatively frequent language editions do not introduce undue instability: Users who pin the language edition in their `.cabal` file or so are not affected by the existence of a new one. Neither are users who pin their GHC version. Only those users who upgrade their version of GHC _and_ ask for the latest edition may now have access to new features.

As `Arnaud explained on the mailing list <https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/ghc-steering-committee/2022-November/002949.html>`_, Rust (generally not perceived as a language with a perception of low stability) has a very similar model with their “language editions”.

Furthermore, a regular, not too slow cadence makes the whole process more
predictable, which I expect *improves* the perception of stability, in the
sense of delivering a stable flow of changes.


Why add DataKinds and TypeData?
-------------------------------

We're considering ``GADTs`` and ``TypeFamilies`` for adoption. Both of
them greatly benefit from ``DataKinds`` and ``TypeData`` (so do
phantom types in plain Haskell 2010 for that matter). They let us
inject more types at the type level. On the other hand if we reject ``GADTs`` and
``TypeFamilies`` from ``GHC2024``, then we ``DataKinds`` and
``TypeData`` may not pull their weight.

That being said, `it's been suggested
<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/613#issuecomment-1761015976>`_
that having ``DataKinds`` on yields better error messages when
mistakenly using a data constructor in types:

::

  foo :: Just Int
  foo = Just 0

With ``DataKinds`` the error message is::

  <interactive>:2:19: error: [GHC-83865]
      • Expected a type, but ‘Just Int’ has kind ‘Maybe (*)’
      • In the type signature: foo :: Int -> Just Int

With ``NoDataKinds``::

  <interactive>:4:19: error: [GHC-76037]
      Not in scope: type constructor or class ‘Just’
      Suggested fix:
        Perhaps you intended to use DataKinds
        to refer to the data constructor of that name?

Both ``DataKinds`` and ``TypeData`` are used the same way at the
type-level, the former lets us reuse types that we are using in
computations at the type level, whereas the latter lets us define type
purely for type level computations.

*Counterarguments*: ``TypeData`` is still rather new, being only
released in GHC 9.6. It's probably too early to consider that we have
sufficient feedback on its merits. Nevertheless, it's innocuous enough
to deserve a vote.

*Backward compatibility*: Enabling `DataKinds`_ or `TypeData`_ does
not affect existing ``GHC2021`` code.

Why add DefaultSignatures?
------------------------------

There is no strong argument for inclusion of
`DefaultSignatures`_. But nor is there for rejecting
it. ``DefaultTypeSignatures`` seems quite stable and there hasn't been
any pushback against the feature. It's a situational, but useful
extension that we don't really have expectations to change.

*Counterarguments*: `It's been pointed out
<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/613#issuecomment-1759419147>`_
that the most common use of default type signatures is with generic
deriving and ``DeriveAnyClass`` (which is not considered for inclusion
in ``GHC2024`` because it's seen as too error prone). An alternative,
for this use-case would be to use deriving-via with the
``Generically`` type class. But there are other uses, and
`Deriving-via doesn't always work
<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/613#issuecomment-1760024807>`_.

*Backward compatibility*: Enabling `DefaultSignatures`_ does not
affect existing ``GHC2021`` code.

Why add DerivingStrategies?
---------------------------

Since `GeneralisedNewtypeDeriving`_ is part of ``GHC2021``, it would make sense
to allow users to be explicit about when it is being used using
`DerivingStrategies`_.  For example: ::

  newtype T = MkT String
    deriving stock Eq
    deriving newtype Show

Some users prefer this style, and there is little downside to being explicit
about the deriving strategy in use.  Note that ``GHC2021`` does not include
``DerivingVia`` or ``DeriveAnyClass``, so these strategies will still need the
corresponding extension to be enabled explicitly.

*Backward compatibility*: Enabling `DerivingStrategies`_ does not affect
existing ``GHC2021`` code.


Why add DisambiguateRecordFields?
---------------------------------

Suppose there are two record fields from different data types in scope, and they
have the same name.  When the field is used in record construction or pattern
matching, it is easy to resolve which datatype is meant using the name of the
data constructor, but ``Haskell2010`` and ``GHC2021`` do not do so.  For
example, the following is rejected: ::

  module M where
    data S = MkS { x :: Int }

  module N where
    data T = MkT { x :: Int }

  module P where
    import M
    import N

    t = MkS { x = 3 }  -- ambiguous name resolution error for "x"

For a long time, GHC has supported the `DisambiguateRecordFields`_ extension,
which makes use of the constructor name to allow this program to be accepted.
This is a small quality-of-life improvement for users, who may otherwise see
this error and not immediately understand why GHC does not make the "obvious"
choice.

This is a simple extension, affecting name resolution only, without involving
any type-directed disambiguation.  It does not allow the definition of clashing
field names in a single module, but makes it easier to avoid unnecessary errors
when importing two modules that happen to use the same field name in different
records.

*Backward compatibility*: Enabling `DisambiguateRecordFields`_ does not affect
existing ``GHC2021`` code.


Why add ExplicitNamespaces?
---------------------------

As discussed in `issue #551
<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/issues/551>`_, ``GHC2021``
includes `TypeOperators`_, but does not include `ExplicitNamespaces`_. This was
a very strange (and probably inadvertent) decision, given that the flag
``-XTypeOperators`` enables both the `TypeOperators`_ and the
`ExplicitNamespaces`_ language extension.

It seems to be a bad idea to retroactive *change* ``GHC2021`` to fix this (we
do care about stability after all), but we should certainly fix this in the
upcoming edition.

And – at least if one accepts that regular releases of ``GHC20xx`` are a Good
Thing™, adding `ExplicitNamespaces`_ alone should be sufficient to cut a new
release.

A counter-argument to `ExplicitNamespaces`_ is that it has seen changes
recently, e.g. in `#281 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/281>`_ and
`#581 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/581>`_.
Thus it may not yet be as stable as we want for ``GHC20xx``. To keep GHC20xx
stable we could amend #281 to ask for a new extension name for syntax added there.

*Backward compatibility*: Enabling `ExplicitNamespaces`_ does not affect
existing ``GHC2021`` code.


Why add GADTs and MonoLocalBinds?
---------------------------------

``GHC2021`` includes both `GADTSyntax`_ and `ExistentialQuantification`_, but
does not include `GADTs`_ or `MonoLocalBinds`_.  Moreover, the combination of
``GADTSyntax`` and ``ExistentialQuantification`` is enough to define GADTs and
pattern match on them (see `GHC issue #21102
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/21102>`_ for detailed discussion).

GHC 9.4 and later permits pattern-matching on an imported GADT regardless of
which extensions are enabled, but doing so will emit a warning from
``-Wgadt-mono-local-binds`` if ``MonoLocalBinds`` is disabled.  This is
consistent with the principle that extensions are required at definition sites
but not use sites.  (GHC 9.2 and previous versions required ``GADTs`` or
``TypeFamilies`` to be enabled in order to pattern match on a GADT.)

Enabling ``MonoLocalBinds`` is considered necessary for robust type inference
when pattern matching on GADTs (see section 4.2 of `OutsideIn(X): Modular type
inference with local assumptions
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/jfp-outsidein.pdf>`_).
Moreover, writing type signatures for polymorphic local bindings generally makes
it easier to understand the code.  However, the type signature requirement makes
it more difficult to factor out repeated code into a ``where`` clause (e.g. see
`GHC issue #19396 <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19396>`_), and
this can surprise users and cause backwards incompatibility.

Since ``ExistentialQuantification`` allows defining types with contexts that
include equality constraints, there is not really a principled distinction
between ``ExistentialQuantification`` and ``GADTs``.  (While there is a
syntactic distinction between GADT syntax and "traditional" datatype syntax,
both forms are capable of expressing simple ADTs, existentially quantified
types, and GADTs.)

Possible ways to resolve this infelicity include:

* Add ``GADTs`` and ``MonoLocalBinds`` to ``GHC2024``.  This makes it clear
  that GADTs/existentials are a core part of the language, and makes the type
  inference compromises necessary to accommodate them.  Migration advice for
  ``GHC2024`` should make clear that type signatures may need to be added for
  local bindings (or ``NoMonoLocalBinds`` specified explicitly).  Given that
  ``MonoLocalBinds`` is a simpler design which can safely be extended with
  ``GADTs``, it makes sense to have it be part of the base language; users can
  then opt-in explicitly to ``NoMonoLocalBinds`` as an extension if required.

* Add ``GADTs`` but not ``MonoLocalBinds``.  This is mostly consistent with
  ``GHC2021``, but means that type inference for local bindings may not be
  predictable when using GADTs.  Moreover, including an extension but not the
  extensions it implies is itself confusing (as with
  ``TypeOperators``/``ExplicitNamespaces`` in ``GHC2021``).

* Remove ``ExistentialQuantification`` from ``GHC2024``.  This means
  existentials/GADTs are clearly treated as an extension, albeit an extension
  that makes type inference "worse". Users will need to understand the impact
  of ``MonoLocalBinds`` only if they import a GADT or define one after enabling
  ``GADTs`` explicitly. Migration advice for ``GHC2024`` should make clear that
  users may need to enable ``GADTs`` explicitly (and possibly give type
  signatures for local bindings or specify ``NoMonoLocalBinds``).

*Backward compatibility*: Enabling ``GADTs`` alone does not break existing ``GHC2021`` code
(because it is equivalent to the current situation),
but enabling ``MonoLocalBinds`` does.


Why add ImpredicativeTypes?
---------------------------

The current design seems to work well for many use-cases and is
unlikely to change. It's been around since GHC 9.2. Besides, some form
of impredicativity seems to be intuitively expected by many
programmers. The time seems ripe.

Why add LambdaCase?
-------------------

The latest `State of Haskell 2021 Survey results
<https://taylor.fausak.me/2022/11/18/haskell-survey-results/>`_ list
`LambdaCase`_ as the top answer to “Which extension would you want to be on by
default”. It also missed ``GHC2021`` by just two votes. There is a whole style
of writing Haskell that makes extensive use of ``\case``. And (unlike the runner up in the survey, `OverloadedStrings`_), it only enables *new* syntax, i.e. it does not change existing code.

A counter-agument to adding `LambdaCase` is that just extended the meaning of
`LambdaCase`_ with ``\cases`` in `#302
<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/302>`_, and if one only
wants to add extensions to ``GHC20xx`` that have been proven to be stable, then
this one probably isn’t yet.

*Backward compatibility*: Enabling `LambdaCase`_ does not affect
existing ``GHC2021`` code, with the exception of lambda-bound variable names
``cases`` (GHC already forbids the ``\case`` even without ``-XLambdaCase``).


Why add RoleAnnotations?
------------------------

Roles are an essential part of modern GHC Haskell.
Role annotations are required for correctly writing types with internal invariants like ``Set`` or "fast" implementations like ``data Fin (n :: Nat) = UnsafeFin Int``.

As `GeneralisedNewtypeDeriving`_ is in the ``GHC2021`` language set, so should be `RoleAnnotations`_. They are different sides of the same feature: without correct role annotations GND cannot be used safely.

At the moment, using ``GHC2021`` together with `Safe`_ causes a warning, because Safe Haskell regards `GeneralisedNewtypeDeriving`_ as unsafe (see `#19605 <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19605>`_ for discussion of this issue). A plausible way to resolve this would be to regard `GeneralisedNewtypeDeriving`_ as safe, but that assumes library authors are aware of the need for correct role annotations and insert them as needed.

*Backward compatibility*: Enabling `RoleAnnotations`_ does not affect
existing ``GHC2021`` code.


Why add TypeFamilies?
---------------------

Type families are one of the most used features of GHC. The reason for
not including `TypeFamilies`_ in ``GHC2021`` was that type families
don't work so well without `MonoLocalBinds`_, and it was considered at
the time that ``MonoLocalBinds`` was too steep a change.

But if we add ``MonoLocalBinds`` to ``GHC2024``, there is no
obstacle to make this very popular feature.

*Counterarguments*: `A reason not to include
<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/613#issuecomment-1759556663>`
that the semantics of type families (in particular the strictness of
its evaluation) is unsatisfactory and would like it to change before
they become a default. But there are two possibility: either the
semantic change is backward compatible, in which case including
``TypeFamilies`` in ``GHC2024`` won't cause any issue; or the semantic
change isn't backward compatible, in which case the massive popularity
of type families makes it impossible to incorporate the change in the
``TypeFamilies`` extension, and ``GHC2024`` is safe.

*Backward compatibility*: Assuming that ``MonoLocalBinds`` is enabled,
enabling ``TypeFamilies`` doesn't affect existing ``GHC2021`` code
further.

Why add BlockArguments?
-----------------------

`BlockArguments`_ denoises common idioms, e.g. `when` for `forM` in do blocks, by not requiring
parentheses or `$`. The resulting non-verbose syntax is arguably very Haskelly, and some
people working with languages that have this already (Agda, PureScript, Lean) report beeing happy about it.

*Backward compatibility*: No incompatibilities (accoridng to the original proposal).

Alternatives
------------
We could not do ``GHC2024`` and wait yet another year, or more, because we shy away from
making what may look like a stability-threatening change.
In my view that is worse: The fixes and improvements suggested above would reach our users later, we would not establish a regular and predictable pattern, and in the worst case never dare to make a new release, which would make the ``GHC20xx`` idea fall into a similar pattern than the ``Haskell20xx`` report process, which at the moment is stalled.
