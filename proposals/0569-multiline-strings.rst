Most languages have native support for writing strings with newlines. Rust supports it out of the box with the normal ``"`` syntax, Python and Scala have ``"""`` syntax, and Javascript/Typescript has backticks. This proposal recommends adding ``"""`` as a delimiter which starts and ends a multiline string that automatically strips the common whitespace prefix from lines.

This proposal is heavily influenced by Java's text blocks in `JEP 378 <https://openjdk.org/jeps/378>`_.

Motivation
----------

Currently you could do this with ``unlines`` (more commonly) or string gaps (`report <https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch2.html#x7-200002.6>`_):

::

  s1 = unlines
    [ "line 1"
    , "line 2"
    , "line 3"
    ]

  s1_2 = "line 1\n\
         \line 2\n\
         \line 3\n"

Using ``unlines`` is decent, but it's a bit verbose. The verbosity becomes more apparent when building multiline strings with double quotes, e.g. rendering Haskell code or SQL queries.

::

  s2 = unlines
    [ "x :: String"
    , "x = a ++ b"
    , "  where"
    , "    a = \"Hello \""
    , "    b = \"world!\""
    ]

  s3 = unlines
    [ "SELECT \"id\", \"name\""
    , "FROM \"user\""
    , "WHERE \"name\" ILIKE 'Alice%'"
    ]

Compare with multiline strings:

::

  s1' =
    """
    line 1
    line 2
    line 3
    """

  s2' =
    """
    x :: String
    x = a ++ b
      where
        a = "Hello "
        b = "world!"
    """

  s3' =
    """
    SELECT "id", "name"
    FROM "user"
    WHERE "name" ILIKE 'Alice%'
    """

Third party libraries also provide this functionality with quasiquoters, e.g. ``heredoc`` or libraries that also do interpolation like ``string-interpolate``. But Template Haskell is not great:

* It makes compilation difficult in certain environments (e.g. GHCJS)
* It can slow down compilation
* Some people avoid it as much as possible out of principle
* It's a rather heavyweight tool for a seemingly lightweight syntactic feature

Proposed Change Specification
-----------------------------

A working prototype is available at `brandonchinn178/string-syntax <https://github.com/brandonchinn178/string-syntax>`_.

#. Lex ``"""`` as an `additional string delimiter <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/8c0ea25fb4a27d4729aabf73f4c00b912bb0c58d/compiler/GHC/Parser/Lexer.x#L577>`_ when the ``MultilineStrings`` language extension is enabled

#. Post-process the string in the following steps:

   #. Split the string by lexical ``newline`` characters (as defined in the `Haskell report <https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch2.html#x7-160002.2>`_)

   #. Convert leading tabs into spaces

      * In each line, any tabs preceding non-whitespace characters are replaced with spaces up to the next tab stop

        * Same logic as `Section 10.3 <https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch10.html#x17-17800010.3>`_ of the Haskell 2010 Report

      * See the BNF specification in *Section 2.2*
      * See the example in *Section 3.4 Mixing tabs and spaces*

   #. Remove common whitespace prefix in every line

      * See the "Common whitespace prefix calculation" section below for the specification of the calculation
      * If a line only contains whitespace, remove all of the whitespace
      * Don't remove common whitespace immediately after the delimiter, see the example in *Section 3.2 Ignore leading characters*

   #. Join the string back with ``\n`` delimiters

      * Use ``\n`` regardless of the lexical ``newline``\ s present in the file. This matches the behavior of ``unlines``.

   #. If the first character of the string is a newline, remove it

   #. If the last character of the string is a newline, remove it

#. After parsing, it becomes indistinguishable to the equivalent single-quoted string (modulo annotations for exact-printing)

In normal strings, string gaps are effectively equivalent to replacing with ``\&``. They're not simply removed, e.g. ``"\65\   \0"`` results in ``"A0"``. This behavior is preserved in multiline strings; see the examples in *Section 3.3 String gaps* for more details.

Common whitespace prefix calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The common whitespace prefix can be informally defined as "The longest prefix of whitespace shared by all lines in the string, excluding the first line and any whitespace-only lines". It's more precisely defined with the following algorithm:

#. Split the string by ``\n`` characters

#. Ignore the following elements in the list:

   * The first line - see the example in *Section 3.2 Ignore leading characters*
   * Empty lines
   * Lines with only whitespace characters

#. Calculate the longest prefix of whitespace shared by all lines in the remaining list

BNF
~~~

The BNF in `Section 10.2 <https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch10.html#x17-17700010.2>`_ of the Haskell 2010 report is extended as follows::

  literal             → integer | float | char | string | multilineString
  multilineString     → """ {{whitechar} multilineStringLine} """
  multilineStringLine → {graphic⟨\ | """⟩ | space | escape | gap}

Examples
--------

General Walkthrough
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows a walkthrough of the whole process in the spec. For clarity, leading spaces will be marked as ``.``.

Take the following input::

  input =
        """
  ......abc

  ......def
  ..
  ....ghi
  ........\njkl
  ..."""

Step 1 - After lexing, this input is parsed as::

  "\n......abc\n\n......def\n..\n....ghi\n........\\njkl\n..."

Here, we distinguish between lexed newlines (``\n``) and escaped newlines written by the user (``\\n``).

Step 2i - There are no string gaps, so no changes in this step.

Step 2ii - Split the string by newlines::

  [ ""
  , "......abc"
  , ""
  , "......def"
  , ".."
  , "....ghi"
  ,"........\\njkl"
  , "..."
  ]

Step 2iii - There are no tabs, so no changes in this step.

Step 2iv - To calculate the common whitespace prefix, we exclude the blank lines and the whitespace-only lines. So we calculate 4 spaces as the prefix, and remove it from each line::

  [ ""
  , "..abc"
  , ""
  , "..def"
  , ""
  , "ghi"
  , "....\\njkl"
  , ""
  ]

Step 2v - Then we join back with newline characters::

  "\\n..abc\\n\\n..def\\n\\nghi\\n....\\njkl\\n"

Step 2vi - Since the first character is a newline character, we remove it and are left with the final result::

  "..abc\\n\\n..def\\n\\nghi\\n....\\njkl\\n"

Step 2vii - Since the last character is a newline character, we remove it and are left with the final result::

  "..abc\\n\\n..def\\n\\nghi\\n....\\njkl"

Step 3 - This gets treated as a normal string from now on, with the escaped ``\\n`` characters interpreted as usual.

Ignore leading characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The common prefix calculation ignores all characters preceding the first newline. This means that characters immediately after the ``"""`` delimiter will be included verbatim. The same would occur with a string gap (since string gaps are collapsed before the prefix calculation).

::

  s =
    """Line 1
       Line 2
    Line 3
    """

  s_2 =
    """\
   \Line 1
       Line 2
    Line 3
    """

  -- equivalent to
  s' = "Line 1\n   Line 2\nLine 3"

This implies that normal strings could also be written using ``"""``

::

  -- the following are equivalent
  s = """hello world"""
  s' = "hello world"

Because characters immediately after the ``"""`` delimiter should be included verbatim, common whitespace will NOT be removed.

::

  s =
    """    hello
    world
    """

  -- equivalent to
  s' = "    hello\nworld"

String gaps
~~~~~~~~~~~

String gaps are collapsed before the whitespace calculation

::

  s =
      """
        a b\
    \ c d e
        f g
      """

  -- equivalent to
  s' = "a b c d e\nf g"

But a string gap starting at the beginning of a line counts as non-whitespace in the whitespace calculation.

::

  -- Imagine \& is substituted for the string gap
  s =
      """
        a b
      \   \  c d e
        f g
      """

  -- equivalent to
  s' = "  a b\n  c d e\n  f g"

Mixing tabs and spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the following example, each line has 16 leading spaces after expanding tabs.

::

  s =
  ⇥"""
  ⇥␣␣␣␣␣␣␣␣a
  ⇥␣⇥b
  ⇥␣␣␣␣⇥c
  ⇥"""

  -- equivalent to
  s' = "a\nb\nc"

Leading newline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The specification strips exactly one leading newline, which is the behavior of least surprise for most devs used to multiline strings. To keep the initial newline, add a blank line before the first line:

::

  s =
    """

    a
    b
    c
    """

  -- equivalent to
  s' = "\na\nb\nc"

The leading newline is removed in step (vi); it has to be done at the end and not the beginning, because any characters on the same line as the opening delimiter should be included verbatim, and removing the leading newline early would treat the first line differently, without more logic.

::

  s1 =
    """    a
    b
    c
    """

  s2 =
    """
    a
    b
    c
    """

  -- In the current proposal, these are equivalent to
  -- the below. If leading newline were removed at the
  -- beginning, both would result in s1'.
  s1' = "    a\nb\nc"
  s2' = "a\nb\nc"

Trailing newline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly to a single leading newline being removed, a single trailing newline will also be removed. To keep the trailing newline, add a blank line after the last line:

::

  s =
    """
    a
    b

    """

  -- equivalent to
  s' = "a\nb\n"

In addition to being symmetric with stripping a single leading newline, stripping a single trailing newline has the benefit of composing better + behaving better with ``putStrLn``.

::

  s1 =
    """
    line 1
    line 2
    """

  s2 = "line 3"

  s3 =
    """
    line 4
    line 5
    """

  putStrLn $ unlines [s1, s2, s3]

  {-
  Without stripping trailing newline:
     "line 1\n"
  ++ "line 2\n"
  ++ "\n"
  ++ "line 3\n"
  ++ "line 4\n"
  ++ "line 5\n"
  ++ "\n"

  With stripping trailing newline:
     "line 1\n"
  ++ "line 2\n"
  ++ "line 3\n"
  ++ "line 4\n"
  ++ "line 5\n"
  -}

This is even more beneficial if we ever add string interpolation as well (See the "Out of scope" section for more details).

::

  s1 =
    """
    line 1
    line 2
    """

  s2 =
    """
    line 3
    line 4
    """

  putStrLn
    s"""
    ${s1}
    ${s2}
    """

  {-
  Without stripping trailing newline:
     "line 1\n"
  ++ "line 2\n"
  ++ "\n"
  ++ "line 3\n"
  ++ "line 4\n"
  ++ "\n"
  ++ "\n"

  With stripping trailing newline:
     "line 1\n"
  ++ "line 2\n"
  ++ "line 3\n"
  ++ "line 4\n"
  -}

The trailing newline is removed in step (vii); it has to be done at the end and not the beginning, because the closing delimiter is probably indented at the same level, so the newline character isn't the last character until after stripping whitespace. Removing the trailing newline at the beginning would require pulling up some of the whitespace stripping logic as well.

Indent every line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To explicitly include whitespace at the beginning of every line, use the ``\&`` escape character to delimit the start of the whitespace to include on every line. Otherwise, the whitespace would be stripped in the "common whitespace prefix" calculation.

In the following example, desugaring ``s1`` into ``s1'`` removes the 2 spaces before each line that may have been intentional. To keep the 2 spaces before each line, one could write either ``s2`` or ``s2_2``, which both result in ``s2'``. One noteworthy aspect of this technique is that it comes for free with the current rules, since ``\&`` is already an escape character meaning "empty string" (https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch2.html#x7-200002.6).

::

  s1 =
    """
      a
      b
      c
    """

  s1' = "a\nb\nc"

  s2 =
    """
    \&  a
      b
      c
    """

  s2_2 =
    """
    \&  a
    \&  b
    \&  c
    """

  s2' = "  a\n  b\n  c"

Escaping triple quotes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only three literal ``"""`` characters in a row will end the multiline string, so escaping any or all of the quote characters will not terminate the string:

::

  x =
    """
    This is a literal multiline string:
    \"\"\"
    Hello
      world!
    \"""
    """

Escaped characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  s =
    """
     name\tage
     Alice\t20
     Bob\t30
    \t40
    """

Since escaped characters are resolved *after* calculating the common whitespace prefix, the leading ``\t`` in the last line is not included in the prefix.

::

  s' = " name\tage\n Alice\t20\n Bob\t30\n\t40"

Example from Fourmolu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With ``unlines``:

::

  adtParseJSON =
    unlines
      [ "\\v -> case v of",
        "  Aeson.Null -> pure PrintStyleInherit",
        "  Aeson.String \"\" -> pure PrintStyleInherit",
        "  _ -> PrintStyleOverride <$> Aeson.parseJSON v"
      ],

  adtParsePrinterOptType =
    unlines
      [ "\\s -> case s of",
        "  \"\" -> pure PrintStyleInherit",
        "  _ -> PrintStyleOverride <$> parsePrinterOptType s"
      ]

With ``string-interpolate``:

::

  adtParseJSON =
    [__i|
    \v -> case v of
      Aeson.Null -> pure PrintStyleInherit
      Aeson.String "" -> pure PrintStyleInherit
      _ -> PrintStyleOverride <$> Aeson.parseJSON v
    |]

  adtParsePrinterOptType =
    [__i|
    \s -> case s of
      "" -> pure PrintStyleInherit
      _ -> PrintStyleOverride <$> parsePrinterOptType s
    |]

With multiline strings:

::

  adtParseJSON =
    """
    \\v -> case v of
      Aeson.Null -> pure PrintStyleInherit
      Aeson.String "" -> pure PrintStyleInherit
      _ -> PrintStyleOverride <$> Aeson.parseJSON v

    """

  adtParsePrinterOptType =
    """
    \\s -> case s of
      "" -> pure PrintStyleInherit
      _ -> PrintStyleOverride <$> parsePrinterOptType s

    """

While the double backslash is still required, I think the overall style is much better (could be resolved in a later proposal adding raw strings).

With ``unlines``:

::

  unlines
    [ printf "instance Aeson.FromJSON %s where" fieldTypeName,
      printf "  parseJSON =",
      printf "    Aeson.withText \"%s\" $ \\s ->" fieldTypeName,
      printf "      either Aeson.parseFail pure $",
      printf "        parsePrinterOptType (Text.unpack s)",
      printf "",
      printf "instance PrinterOptsFieldType %s where" fieldTypeName,
      printf "  parsePrinterOptType s =",
      printf "    case s of",
      unlines_
        [ printf "      \"%s\" -> Right %s" val con
        | (con, val) <- enumOptions
        ],
      printf "      _ ->",
      printf "        Left . unlines $",
      printf "          [ \"unknown value: \" <> show s",
      printf "          , \"Valid values are: %s\"" (renderEnumOptions enumOptions),
      printf "          ]",
      printf ""
    ]

With ``string-interpolate`` (without interpolation, for a fair comparison):

::

  printf
    [__i|
    instance Aeson.FromJSON %s where
      parseJSON =
        Aeson.withText "%s" $ \s ->
          either Aeson.parseFail pure $
            parsePrinterOptType (Text.unpack s)

    instance PrinterOptsFieldType %s where
      parsePrinterOptType s =
        case s of
    %s
          _ ->
            Left . unlines $
              [ "unknown value: " <> show s
              , "Valid values are: %s"
              ]
    |]
    fieldTypeName
    fieldTypeName
    fieldTypeName
    ( unlines_
        [ printf "      \"%s\" -> Right %s" val con
        | (con, val) <- enumOptions
        ]
    )
    (renderEnumOptions enumOptions)

With multiline strings:

::

  printf
    """
    instance Aeson.FromJSON %s where
      parseJSON =
        Aeson.withText "%s" $ \\s ->
          either Aeson.parseFail pure $

      parsePrinterOptType s =
        case s of
    %s
          _ ->
            Left . unlines $
              [ "unknown value: " <> show s

    fieldTypeName
    ( unlines_

        | (con, val) <- enumOptions
        ]
    )
    (renderEnumOptions enumOptions)

Effect and Interactions
-----------------------

A multiline string should be the same as a normal string after parsing, so ``OverloadedStrings`` and any other language features should work as usual.

Should not break existing code, unless someone is actually using ``"""a"""`` to mean ``"" "a" ""``.

Costs and Drawbacks
-------------------

Since this only affects lexing and parsing, I expect development and maintenance costs to be low. This feature is common in other languages, so there shouldn't be any learning curve for new developers coming from another language. If anything, the auto-stripping of leading whitespace might be a source of confusion, but a one-line explanation should be sufficient.

Alternatives
------------

* Status quo, e.g. using ``unlines``

  * As mentioned in the Motivation, it's not great ergonomics, but it works.

* Third party libraries, using quasiquoters

  * Template Haskell is overkill for this

* No stripping of leading whitespace

  * This probably comes from one of two concerns: more complex implementation, conceptually adds automagic. It does make the implementation a bit harder, but this is a small enough change that I don't think it makes the overall proposal much harder to implement. While it does add a bit more magic behind the scenes, I think the rule is simple enough (no more complex than do-block indentation rules) and the use-case common enough (I can't think of a single use-case that would want the indentation to be part of the string) that it warrants the bump in ergonomics.

  * The downside of doing this is that generally speaking, developers will want to keep the multiline string at the same indentation level as surrounding code. Not doing any post processing means that reindenting code would change the string content. I would also posit that the common case is wanting leading whitespace stripped, which would lead to devs putting multiline strings at the 0th column or implementing their own deindenter.

* Only strip leading whitespace with delimiter

  * This alternative can be done in one of two ways:

    #. Special case the delimiter and resolve it at compile-time
    #. Add new ``trimMargin`` / ``trimMarginWith`` functions that trim the delimiter (or some custom delimiter) at runtime

  * The first option involves hardcoding the delimiter in the compiler, which is Not Great. Plus, wanting to actually use the delimiter to start a line in the string would require escaping it.

  * The second option requires adding new functions to ``Prelude`` and would trim the margins at run-time, instead of compile-time. This would also not work with ``OverloadedStrings``

  * Furthermore, any use case that doesn't want to strip leading whitespace either:
    #. Is agnostic to the whitespace (e.g. HTML) so it doesn't matter if it's stripped or not, or
    #. Explicitly needs leading whitespace on every line. In this case, the developer would not be able to reindent their code without changing behavior, so IMO, the developer *should* explicitly opt-in to specify exactly where the indentation should start. This is possible with the "indent every lines" technique listed above. Since it's possible to do this, and I believe a priori that stripping is more common than not-stripping, it doesn't make sense to make this use-case the default.

* Use ``''`` to delimit multiline strings, which has the benefit of being a parse error without ``MultilineStrings``

* Enable any number of ``"""+`` quotes to delimit multiline strings

* Reuse single-quoted ``"`` for multiline syntax

  * Would require escaping double quotes in the multiline string, which, while not a major part of the proposal, is a nice bonus

* New ``[s|foo|]`` construct that embeds a multiline literal string with no TH (so *not* a quasiquoter, but reusing the same syntax)

* Support arbitrary terminators, like Bash's heredocs

  ::

    x = <<EOF
    line 1
    line 2
    line 3
    EOF

  * Everyone will use a different terminator, which I think would contribute to a reduction in overall readability
  * I think ``"""`` is an uncommon enough delimiter, and it can be escaped, that I don't think this is necessary

* Use some delimiter to start the string, but use layout indentation rules to dictate when the string ends

* Strip trailing whitespace in post-processing

  * Nice to have, but not necessary. I think it would be better to keep post-processing as minimal as possible, and it doesn't seem as common as removing leading whitespace.

Out of scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* String interpolation

  * See https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/570
  * One way this proposal can work with raw strings is by allowing both ``s"..."`` and ``s"""..."""`` syntaxes. In general, any raw strings proposal that works with the current double quoted string syntax should be able to work with a triple-quoted string syntax as well, since the proposed triple-quoted string syntax desugars to a single-quoted string.

* "Raw" strings (without escaping)

  * To an extent, this proposal already helps this a little bit, since double quotes no longer need to be escaped within a triple-quoted string. But this proposal doesn't address needing to escape backslashes.
  * This is particularly useful for regexes or any other situation where the backslash character is useful as an actual character.
  * One way this proposal can work with raw strings is by allowing both ``r"..."`` and ``r"""..."""`` syntaxes. See comment in "String interpolation".

Comparisons with other languages
--------------------------------

* Java

  * As mentioned in the beginning, this proposal draws a lot from Java.

  * Java strips trailing whitespace. See "Strip trailing whitespace" under "Alternatives".

  * Java defines the content to start after the first newline after the opening ``"""``, and disallows any non-whitespace characters after the opening delimiter. Instead of adding this restriction, we added the rule to remove exactly one newline from the beginning of the string, if one exists. This allows people to start the multiline string on the same line, enabling one-line strings to use the syntax, e.g. ``"""A string using "unescaped" quotes"""``.

  * Java includes the line that the closing ``"""`` delimiter is on, so that the position of the closing delimiter is included in the common-prefix calculation. One motivation for this was to enable indenting every line. However, discussion on this proposal indicated that this was too magical and would be confusing behavior. Instead of this, we can reuse Haskell's existing ``\&`` escape character to add indentation to every line. See the example in *Section 3.7 Indent every line* and the "Only strip leading whitespaces with delimiter" alternative.

  * This proposal also adds the addition of collapsing string gaps before any post-processing, which is a Haskell-specific syntax.

* Python, Groovy, Kotlin, Scala, Swift

  * All of these languages use ``"""`` to delimit multi-line strings.

  * Most of them keep the multiline string verbatim; to strip indentation, each language provides functions: Python = ``textwrap.dedent``, Kotlin/Groovy/Scala provide some version of ``stripIndent`` or ``stripMargin``.

  * Swift uses Java's method of using the closing delimiter to determine the leading whitespace to strip

* Go, Javascript

  * These languages use a single backtick to delimit multi-line strings.

  * None of them strip indentation automatically. Go has the ``dedent`` library, Javascript can do ``s.replace(/^\s{4}/g, '')``.

* C#

  * Allows opening with at least 3 ``"`` characters

  * Strips newline after opening delimiter and before closing delimiter.

  * Uses Java's method of using the closing delimiter to determine the leading whitespace to strip

  * Also allows ``@"..."`` syntax, which won't work for us, as ``@`` is used for type applications, in this case, a type application for a ``Symbol``.

* Ruby

  * Normal double quoted strings can be on multiple lines, does not strip whitespace
  * ``<<-EOF``: heredoc, does not strip whitespace
  * ``<<~EOF``: heredoc, strips whitespace
  * ``%q(...)``: does not strip whitespace

* C, C++

  * Raw string literals with ``R"..."``.
