Bring back ``class Eval``
=========================

This proposal is to add a language extension that, when specified, rolls back the ``seq`` semantics to their Haskell 1.3
state.

Motivation
----------

The main benefit, in the medium term, would be to make Haskell fully parametric again. In the longer term, we could aim
to make η-conversion and foldr-build optimization safe, to reopen the possibility of unlifted products (*i.e.*,
``newtype`` with multiple fields), and possibly to satisfy Bob Harper. Here is some background reading material that
explains the existing problems:

- `η-equivalence in Haskell <http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19165/is-eta-equivalence-for-functions-compatiable-with-haskells-seq-operation>`_
- `Haskell has no state monad <http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~nicsma/no-state-monad.html>`_
- `Hask is not a category <http://math.andrej.com/2016/08/06/hask-is-not-a-category/>`_
- `Correctness of short cut fusion <https://wiki.haskell.org/Correctness_of_short_cut_fusion#In_the_absence_of_seq>`_
- `Haskell is exceptionally unsafe <https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2012/08/14/haskell-is-exceptionally-unsafe/>`_

Proposed Change
---------------

**First**, Restore class ``Eval`` and its methods much as they were in Haskell 1.3 specification, only renaming the
method ``strict`` to its modern equivalent ``$!``
::
    class Eval a where
      ($!)    :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
      seq     :: a -> b -> b
      f $! x  =  x `seq` f x

Like ``Typeable``, the ``Eval`` class is implicitly derived for every data type, including functions, and its instances
cannot be explicitly defined.

As a consequence of this change, the ``Eval`` class would start appearing in the inferred type context of expressions
using ``seq``. For example, the inferred type of function ``f x = seq x x`` would become ``f :: forall a. Eval a => a ->
a``.

**Second**, add a new language option, namely ``-XNoUniversalEval`` together with its evil twin ``-XUniversalEval``. The
latter option would be the default one, and it would be equivalent to having the ``{-# INCOMPLETE_CONTEXTS Eval #-}``
pragma specified. The effects of this pragma are described in another proposal:

https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/34

In any module compiled with ``-XUniversalEval``, the class ``Eval`` would be satisfied by every type of kind
``*``. Furthermore, every explicit type signature would be considered equivalent to the same signature with the context
``Eval a =>`` added for every type variable ``a :: *``. The example function ``f`` above would thus still compile even
if accompanied by an explicit type signature ``f :: forall a. a -> a``.

In a module compiled with ``-XNoUniversalEval`` the class ``Eval`` would become a normal class, subject to the usual
type equivalence rules. Any polymorphic use of ``seq`` would trigger a compilation error, including the above
example. The same constraint would apply to bang patterns and the strict data bang, but monomorphic applications of
``seq`` and bang would not be affected.

**Third**, add the ``Eval =>`` context to the type signatures of ``Data.List.foldl'`` and all other strict functions in
the ``base`` library. That includes ``Data.Foldable.foldl'`` and other class methods whose instances are expected to be
strict.

This proposal is orthogonal to all existing language extensions. This includes even ``StrictHaskell``, though the
combination of this one with ``-XNoUniversalEval`` in the same module might prove impractical.

Details
-------

All data types declared with ``data`` would have an automatically derived ``Eval`` instance. The inferred type of any
constructor declared with strict fields would have ``Eval`` context for such fields, but that would not affect the
type's ``Eval`` instance. The derived instance of a ``newtype``-declared type on the other hand would inherit the
context of the ``Eval`` instance of its sole constructor field. Taking the following type declarations for example:
::
   data Foo a b  = Strict !a !b
                 | HalfStrict !a b
                 | NonStrict a
   newtype Bar a = Bar a

the compiler would derive
::
   Strict     :: (Eval a, Eval b) => a -> b -> Foo a b
   HalfStrict :: Eval a => a -> b -> Foo a b
   NonStrict  :: a -> Foo a b
   
   instance Eval (Foo a b) where
      Strict{}     `seq` x = x
      HalfStrict{} `seq` x = x
      NonStrict{}  `seq` x = x
      
   Bar :: a -> MkBar a
   
   instance Eval a => Eval (Bar a) where
      MkBar a `seq` x = a `seq` x

      
The only effect of strict fields is on the type constructors, the corresponding patterns are not affected in any
way. The patterns ``Strict a b``, ``NonStrict a`` or ``Bar a`` would behave the same way they do today.
::
   f :: Foo a b -> a
   f (Strict x _) = x

If in the future we should introduce unlifted products in the form of multi-field ``newtype``, such as in ``newtype Pair
a b = MkPair a b``, they would likely have no ``Eval`` instance. The reason is that the properties of the instance would
require that
::
   MkPair ⊥ b `seq` x = b `seq` x
   MkPair a ⊥ `seq` x = a `seq` x
   MkPair ⊥ ⊥ `seq` x = ⊥

which could not be implemented without speculative concurrent evaluation of both *a* and *b*.

Backward compatibility issues
-----------------------------

Most of the existing code would continue to work unless the ``-XNoUniversalEval`` option was used. There are some
exceptions that this mechanism would not solve. In particular `(as suggested by Simon
PJ) <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/27#issuecomment-259913953>`_, higher-rank types like
::
   data Rank2 (m :: (* -> *)) = MkRank2 (m Int)
   f :: forall (m :: * -> *). Rank2 m -> Int
   f (MkRank2 x) = x `seq` 42

and GADTs as in
::
   data T m where
     T1 :: m Int -> T m
     T2 :: m Bool -> T m

   f :: T m -> Int
   f (T1 x) = x `seq` 3
   f (T2 y) = y `seq` 5

cause GHC to report a missing ``Eval`` instances on ``(m Int)`` and ``(m Bool)``, but with no accompanying suggestion on
which type signatures to modify. I take this to mean that the `INCOMPLETE_CONTEXTS
<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/34>`_ implementation strategy could not provide an automatic
recovery.
   
Overall, the biggest problem would probably be presented by class instances like
::
   data Foo a = MkFoo a
   instance Functor Foo where
      fmap f (MkFoo x) = x `seq` MkFoo (f x)

In this case, GHC 8.0.2 does helpfully suggest adding ``(Eval a)`` to the context of the type signature as a possible
fix. In this case, unfortunately, the suggested context is wrong:
::
   Possible fix:
     add (Eval a) to the context of
       the type signature for:
         fmap :: (a -> b) -> Foo a -> Foo b

A better suggestion would be to restrict the context of the constructor ``MkFoo``, except that would require the
``ExistentialQuantification`` language extension. Besides, the data type declaration may not be in the same module as
the instance.

This particular instance is breaking the ``Functor`` laws, but that is beside the point. There are other user-defined
classes and data types with those classes' instances that may use ``seq`` in this way. For each of those cases, there
would be three ways to make the instance compile again:

- remove the use of ``seq``, potentially losing the performance,
- add ``(Eval a)`` to the context of the type class method, or
- add ``(Eval a)`` to the context of the data type constructor.

Potential solution
------------------
  
There is a relatively principled way to make GHC accept even these instances. First, let's think about how we could
apply GHC's suggestion manually to the ``Functor`` class. We don't want to modify the ``fmap`` method signature and
affect all well-behaved instances. We can instead add an evil-twin method ``fmap'`` with the required ``Eval`` context:
::
   {-# LANGUAGE UniversalEval #-}
   class Functor f where
      fmap  ::                     (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
      fmap' :: (Eval a, Eval b) => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
      fmap' = fmap
      fmap  = fmap'

Of course the ``Functor`` class is out of our reach by the time we encounter the bad instance, so we can't do this in
retrospect. And we certainly don't want to do it manually. Rather, we want GHC to perform this magic for all class
definitions in any module compiled with ``-XUniversalEval``. Somewhat more exactly, GHC would automatically shadow every
method with free type variables with another method whose type signature adds an ``Eval`` constraint to each type
variable. The generated methods would be accessible only for the error-recovery purposes in class instances, and only in
modules compiled with ``-XUniversalEval``.

Note that this is an optional extension to the proposal. It's not clear if the instance backward compatibility problems
will be severe enough to justify the complexity of the fix.

Drawbacks
---------

The main reason given for dropping the ``Eval`` class from Haskell 98 given in *A History of Haskell: Being Lazy With
Class* (§10.3) was ease of debugging. Specifically, if one wants for debugging purposes to temporarily invoke ``seq`` in
a polymorphic function, that forces adding the ``Eval a =>`` context to the explicit type signatures of that function
and all its polymorphic callers.

Personally, that justification strikes me as strange. Haskell is not otherwise known for weakening the language
properties in order to accommodate development procedures or tooling.

The main drawback to clamping down on ``seq`` today is the quantity of code that's using it unconstrained. Still, we
have to start somewhere. My hope is that one day ``-XNoUniversalEval`` will become the default and the
``-XUniversalEval`` pragma will be necessary to apply ``seq`` willy-nilly.

If this change were to happen today, there would certainly be plenty of broken code. The breakage would probably *not*
be in the low-level libraries that heavily depend on strictness annotations for optimization. That code is typically
monomorphic and thus wouldn't be affected.

Alternatives
------------

A previous version of this proposal started by adding a new module named ``Data.Eval``, exporting the class ``Eval`` and
its methods. There would thus be two variants of ``seq``, the polymorphic one in ``Prelude`` and the safe one in
``Data.Eval``, and users would opt into using the latter by importing ``Data.Eval``.

This cunning plan would require virtually no change to GHC, but unfortunately it fell apart on the ``foldl'`` and
``foldr'`` methods of the ``Foldable`` class. We can't simply export an alternative ``Foldable`` class from
``Data.Eval.Foldable`` because the two classes would be incompatible.

I considered adding yet another pair of language options, ``LiftedFunctions`` and ``UnliftedFunctions``. The former
would be on by default. The latter option, where specified, would prevent the ``Eval`` class from being implicitly
derived for function types. However, different designs are possible (should a function type ``Bool -> Int`` still be an
instance of ``Eval``? how about a ``DataEval`` subclass of ``Eval``?) and I felt this was better left for a future
proposal, if this one should take.

I had also considered extending the *SafeHaskell* inference mechanism. It could infer a module *EtaSafe* if it's *Safe*
or *Trustworthy*, all its imports are *EtaSafe*, and no ``seq`` use in the module is polymorphic nor applied to a
function type. I dropped this idea mostly because it seemed wrong to conflate ``unsafePerformIO`` and polymorphic
``seq``; they are not unsafe in the same sense. Besides, I'm not convinced the *EtaSafe* certificate would attract much
attention.

Unresolved Questions
--------------------

It would be nice to get some estimate of the proportion of existing packages that cannot be compiled with
``-XNoUniversalEval``.
