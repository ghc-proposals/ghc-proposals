This proposal introduces local quantifiers into GHC, which grabs local type variables.

Motivation
----------

With GHC's powerful type-level programming features, we need powerful abilities to explicitly bring local type variables into the scope. 

To write some trivial functions ``ScopedTypeVariables`` extension is needed (or ``TypeAbstractions``), which adds implicit rules for how to read type signatures!

And this is a bit unhandy to use implicit-only rules in a language that has a huge system of types.

Right now there are three kinds of scoped:

* The scope local to each type signature
::

  id :: forall a. a -> a -- 'a' is introduced and used only within this type signature

* The lexical scope around a type signature (modified by ``TypeAbstractions``)
::

  {-# LANGUAGE TypeAbstractions #-}
  const :: forall a. a -> b -> a
  const @a x = res where
    res :: a -- uses 'a' from the lexical scope '@a'
    res = x

* The magical / borrowed scope introduced by ``ScopedTypeVariables``
::

  {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}
  const :: forall a. a -> b -> a
  const x = res where
    res :: a -- uses 'a' from parent signature 'const :: forall a.'
    res = x

Notice how the signature res :: ``a`` in 1 & 2 does not itself say where ``a`` comes from.

This is confusing because traditionally Haskell has made it optional to write "forall" in a signature, so it is unclear if ``res :: a`` means ``res :: forall a. a`` or the other thing (and it's not even possible to express what that the other meaning is currently!).

This proposal says such uses of a should explicitly say they use '``a``' from somewhere else (exactly which-where) in the program.

This Proposal suggests to add the **ForThis Quantifier**, **ForThat Quantifier**, **ForSame Quantifier** and **ForUsed Quantifier**, **ForInner Quantifier**, **ForNested Quantifier** which allow to write explicitly type signatures, which depends from internal or external type variables.

Explicitness is preferential in Haskell over implicitness. And this Proposal propose how to write local quantifiers explicitly! It does not aim to allow writing more programs, just to allow being more explicit about where type variables come from. Non-quantified type variable means that this variable is somehow-quantified.

Just like ``ExplicitForall`` extension allow explicitly say exactly what this specific type variable is ``forall`` quantified, this Proposal allow to switch on ``LocalQuantifiers`` extension explicitly say exactly what this specific type variable is local quantified!
 
Main alternative is "Modern Scoped Type Variables" `#448`_ which was added into ``ScopedTypeVariables`` extension and ``TypeAbstractions`` extension.

``ScopedTypeVariables`` is *de facto* **Implicit Local Quantifiers** : Implicit rules to add a local scope (or universal) quantifier to type variables if they are not explicitly quantified.

Also Alternative is ``PartialTypeSignatures`` extension, with opposite philosophy: compiler infer type not for holes.


Rule (aka math-like proof)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

De facto Local Quantifiers are a special case of Existential Quantifier, which is known during compile time.

**Math-like Proof:**

All local scoped and parametric non-quantified type variables in Haskell are unique quantified (if not ``forall``-quantified) type variables.

::

  -- pseudo-haskell
  
  f1 :: ∀ a. [a] -> [a]
  f1 (x:xs) = xs ++ [ x :: ∃₌₁ b. b ]

  f :: ∀ a. [a] -> [a]
  f xs = ys ++ ys
     where
       ys :: ∃₌₁ b. [b]
       ys = reverse xs

If we use mathematical iduction we could shaw that all "similar" cases could use unique quantifier.

Main benefit is that all local quantifiers are utilized by Haskell-renamer, so nothing is required to change in Core-language.

Local Quantifiers are just explanation to GHC which external type variable they means.


Proposed Change Specification
-----------------------------

Local Quantifiers "grab"(use) already existed type variables external to this signature
::

  f :: forall a b. [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
  f @aa @bb xs ys  = zip (xs :: forthis aa. [aa]) yys
     where
       yys :: forused _ b. [b]
       yys = reverse ys


By using ``for<local> a`` quantifier we ask do not create a new type variable ``forall a``, but use already existed external type variable ``a``.

1. ForThis ``forthis`` quantifier pick type variable **by name** lifted from explicit **type-term** argument (``@tyterm``), not from **type**.

2. ForThat ``forthat`` quantifier pick type variable **by name** from ``class``, ``instance``, ``data``, ``type`` and ``newtype`` head type variable.

3. ForSame ``forsame`` quantifier pick type variable **by name** from explicit only signature declaration.

4. ForUsed ``forused`` quantifier pick type variable **by position** from ``forall`` in signature declarations (regardless if explicitly written or implicitly infered) in one-to-one corresponded order.

5. ForInner ``forinner`` quantifier pick type variable **by position** from inner ``forall`` from Existential types and GADS-like types (regardless if explicitly written or implicitly infered) in one-to-one corresponded order.

6. ForNested ``fornested`` quantifier pick type variable **by position** from signature high-ranked ``forall`` argument in one-to-one corresponded order (regardless if explicitly written or implicitly infered).

Since ``forthis`` , ``forthat`` , ``forsame`` are quantifier by picking by name, they must use same **name** for type variable as external ones.

Since ``forused`` , ``forinner`` , ``fornested`` are quantifier by picking by position, they must cold use **name** for type variable different from external ones.

Local quantifier's type variable "grabs" type variables only from nearest parent signature.

Local quantifier's type variable could "grabs" type variables only from nearest *grand*-parent signature - then we use coma ``,`` for this (except ``forthat`` quantifier).

Local quantifier's type variable could "grabs" type variables only from nearest *grand-..-grand*-parent signature - then we use additional comas ``,`` for this.

Local quantifier's which pick type variable *by position*:

1. Could use pure wildcard ``_`` for unused variable. This means use ``for<local> _ _ a.`` instead of ``for<local> unused1 unused2 a.``

2. Could omit all unused variables "righter" then last used one. This means use ``for<local> a.`` instead of ``for<local> a _ _ _.``

3. Could omit all variables if all of them are unused from some signature. This means use ``for<local> ,, a.`` instead of ``for<local> _ _ _, _ _, a.``

4. ``forused`` must use semicolon ``;`` for shifted ``forall`` to omit *term* argument. This means write ``forused _ ; b.`` if signature is ``f :: forall a. a -> forall b. b -> ...``

5. ``forinner`` and ``fornested`` must use semicolon ``;`` for shifted ``forall`` to omit *type* argument. This means write ``for{local} _ ; b.`` if signature is ``f :: forall a. a -> forall b. T b -> ...``

Since ForSame Quantifier uses explicit signature declaration only and ignore shifted ``forall`` , we mark ``forsame`` as **DEPRECATED**. But this quantifier is useful for future of ``ScopedTypeVariables`` extension


Extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduce a new extension ``-XLocalQuantifiers`` .

With ``-XLocalQuantifiers`` words ``forthis``, ``forthat``, ``forsame``, ``forused``, ``forinner``, ``fornested`` becomes keywords in types.

Syntax
~~~~~~

Syntax for local quantifiers has a simple form.

::

  type ::= ......
       | 'forthat'   { tyvar } tyvar '.'
       | 'forthis'   { ',' | tyVar } tyVar '.'
       | 'forsame'   { ',' | tyVar } tyVar '.'              -- DEPRECATED
       | 'forused'   { ';' | ',' | tyVar } tyVar '.'
       | 'forinner'  { ';' | ',' | tyVar } tyVar '.'
       | 'fornested' { ';' | ',' | tyVar } tyVar '.'

Every local quantifier is utilized by the Haskell renamer, so no changes are required for the Core Language.

Examples
--------

Almost every example from  "Modern Scoped Type Variables" `#448`_ could be used with local quantifiers

  f4 @a True  x (y :: forthis a. a) = x
  f4    False x y                   = y   -- accepted: the type signature allows us to do this

  g (x:: forused a. a) = x
  
  -- Example 2

Effect and Interactions
-----------------------

UnicodeSyntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We wish to preserve ``∃`` (There Exists, U+2203) symbol for universal existential quantifier, so it is proposed to add 2 symbols (``∃`` + ``<something>``) to represent local quantifiers.

1. ``∃†`` could represent ``forthis`` quantifier (There Exists, U+2203) + (Dagger, U+2020).

2. ``∃§`` could represent ``forthat`` quantifier (There Exists, U+2203) + (Section Sign, U+00A7).

3. ``∃∝`` could represent ``forsame`` quantifier (There Exists, U+2203) + (Proportional To, U+221D).

4. ``∃∴`` could represent ``forused`` quantifier (There Exists, U+2203) + (Therefore, U+2234).

5. ``∃☈`` could represent ``forinner`` quantifier (There Exists, U+2203) + (Thunderstorm, U+2608).

6. ``∃∂`` could represent ``fornested`` quantifier (There Exists, U+2203) + (Partial Differential, U+2202).

Examples
::

  id :: ∀ a. a -> a
  id @t x = x :: ∃† t. t

  f1 :: ∀ a b. [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
  f1 @aa @bb xs ys  = zip (xs :: ∃† aa. [aa]) yys
     where
       yys :: ∃∴ _ b. [b]
       yys = reverse ys

  f2 :: Maybe Int -> Int
  f2 Nothing   = (4 :: ∃☈ a. a)
  f2 (Just _)  = (5 :: ∃☈ a. a)

  class D a where
    m :: ∃§ a. a -> a

  instance Num a => D [a] where
    m :: ∃§ a. [a] -> [a]
    m x = map (*2) x

ScopedTypeVariables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ScopedTypeVariables`` extension ignores local quantified variables.

But we could reuse part of searching algorithms from ``ScopedTypeVariables`` algorithms.

Visible ForAll and ForEach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since local quantifiers just use already existing type variables, there is no need to be used as visible or as unerased quantifiers.

NoImplicitForAll
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Proposal do not contradicts ``NoImplicitForAll`` extension.

Costs and Drawbacks
-------------------

We expect the implementation and maintenance costs of ``LocalQuantifiers`` has medium difficulty.


Alternatives
------------

Main alternative is "Modern Scoped Type Variables" `#448`_ (``ScopedTypeVariables`` extension), but also ``TypeAbstractions`` and ``PartialTypeSignatures``.

Alternative keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We could choose differen keywords instead of proposed latin and unicode keywords.

Howevwer, the template ``for<local>`` and ``∃<something>`` are welcomed.

Freedom of choice for ForThat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to add ``forthat`` quantifier:

- to use it in the head of declaration: ::

   data forthat a. Maybe a  where
        Nothing :: forall a. Maybe a
        Just    :: forall a. a -> Maybe a

- to use it in the body of declaration: ::

   class forall a. Num a  where
        (+) :: forthat a. a -> a - > a
        (*) :: forthat a. a -> a - > a

Second choice looks more "natural".

Backward Compatibility
----------------------

This proposal is fully backward compatible.


Unresolved Questions
--------------------

ForNew
~~~~~~~

It is unclear which local quantifier should be used in next example
::

    data Proxy a = P

    g2 :: Proxy (Nothing @(a, a)) -> ()
    g2 (P @(Nothing :: for??? t. Maybe (t, t))) = ()


We could reuse ``forthat`` for this case or to add a new special quantifier ``fornew``.

Or maybe ``forused t.`` is enough.


Future possibilities
--------------------

ScopedTypeVariables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In future we could rewrite ``ScopedTypeVariables`` extension in terms of local-scoped quantifiers.

Type in terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right now Haskell doesn't support types in terms. If it is allowed, we could add ``forterm`` local quantifier.
::

  t = Int
  foo (x :: forterm t. t) = 0

Implementation Plan
-------------------

It is unclear.
