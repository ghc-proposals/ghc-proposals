We propose that string literals generated by GHC and passed to user
defined functions should have ``fromString`` applied. The only
instance of such GHC generated strings we are aware of is via
``fail``, so we propose to fix that case. Concretely, for monadic
pattern match failures in the presence of the extensions
``RebindableSyntax`` and ``OverloadedStrings``, we desugar to ``fail
(fromString "error")`` instead of ``fail "error"`` .

Motivation
----------
We might expect the following program to work:

.. code-block:: haskell

  {-# LANGUAGE RebindableSyntax #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

  module Fail where

  import Prelude hiding (fail)

  foo x = do
      Just y <- x
      return y

  newtype Text = Text String

  fail :: Text -> a
  fail (Text x) = error x

  fromString :: String -> Text
  fromString = Text

The intent is that the defined ``fail`` should take an argument of
type ``Text`` which is obtained by implicit conversion from
``String``.

However, it fails with,

::

  Fail.hs:8:5-15: error:
  * Couldn't match expected type `[Char]' with actual type `Text'
  * In a stmt of a 'do' block: Just y <- x
    In the expression:
      do Just y <- x
         return y
    In an equation for `foo':
        foo x
          = do Just y <- x
               return y
    |
  8 |     Just y <- x
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^

Proposed Change Specification
-----------------------------
We propose that monadic pattern match failure in the presence of
``RebindableSyntax`` and ``OverloadedStrings`` desugars to ``fail
(fromString "error")`` instead of ``fail "error"``.

Effects and Interactions
------------------------
With this modification, the example program from the “Motivation”
section will type-check. It would be possible for a
``Prelude``-replacement to eliminate ``String`` more completely,
without having to retain it as the input type to ``fail``.

We view this change primarily as a bug fix, which simplifies an
unexpected corner. This proposal originally started out as
https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/15645.

Costs and Drawbacks
-------------------
There may be a small number of libraries that fail to type-check, but
any that have simply enabled the two extensions will continue to work,
as ``fromString`` has an instance for ``String``. In all likelihood,
these are the libraries that have already tried to eliminate
``String``, so are most likely to benefit from the change.

Alternatives
------------
One can work around the problem by requiring the user to write ``fail
= myFail . fromString``, but that requires both ``fail`` and
``myFail`` to be in scope, and the name ``fail`` cannot be reused for
the failure function in the monad typeclass.

Unresolved Questions
--------------------
Should ``fromString`` be injected only when both ``OverloadedStrings``
and ``RebindableSyntax`` are enabled or just ``OverloadedStrings``? We
suggest only when both as, when ``RebindableSyntax`` is not enabled,
the operation ``fail . fromString`` is equivalent to ``fail``.

Implementation Plan
-------------------
We (the proposal authors) will implement the change. Our plan is to
modify ``getFailFunction`` and ``failFunction`` in ``RnExpr.hs`` so
that if the ``RebindableSyntax`` and ``OverloadedStrings`` language
extensions are enabled, then ``fail_op`` becomes ``fail . fromString``
rather than just ``fail``.
