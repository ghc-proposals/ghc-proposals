Principles for GHC
==================

This document lays out high-level principles for the evolution of GHC
and the language it compiles. In much the way that we like to write
*properties* of our functions -- instead of just writing down individual
test cases -- this document strives to write *principles* that our proposals
ought to maintain (or build towards).

Articulating these principles helps to guide future proposals: proposals
that maintain the principles in this document are more likely to be accepted,
while proposals that work against these principles are more likely to be rejected.
Note that neither direction is (at all) a guarantee: there will be excpetions
in both directions. Yet by writing down the principles, we can have an informed
discussion of the tradeoffs of accepted or rejecting an individual proposal.

These priniciples are divided into two section:

* `Language design principles <#2language-design-principles>`_ (Section 2)
* `GHC stability principles <#3GHC-stability-principles>`_ (Section 3)


How to update these principles
------------------------------

When making a proposal, following the `usual guidelines <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/#how-to-start-a-new-proposal>`_,
feel free to include a diff against this listing of principles. We can then
discuss the validity of the new principle(s) alongside the concrete proposal for
a change to GHC.

We urge proposers to resist the temptation to propose principles without an
accompanying concrete change to GHC. Debating principles in the abstract does
not seem a productive use of time, though it is possible to imagine exceptions.
For example, the justification for the rejection of a proposal may be distilled into
a new principle here. Accordingly, this document is not (and presumably never will be)
comprehensive: it contains the articulated prinicples guiding GHC's development
but lacks the unarticulated principles, which will be added over time.

All principles in this document are linked back to the PR that introduce them,
so that readers can learn the context in which they were written.

We use a notational convention here where each principle is given an abbreviation,
but we use its full spelling wherever possible. The full spelling is useful for readers,
given the multitude of principles in play. Including the abbreviation is useful in case
the abbreviation is used in other fora (e.g. email, GitHub, etc.) to allow the curious
to find (e.g. with Ctrl+F) the abbreviation within this page.

Syntax
~~~~~~

Syntactic Unification Principle (SUP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Syntactic Unification Principle`:

**Principle:** In the absence of punning, there is
no difference between type-syntax and term-syntax.

The `Syntactic Unification Principle`_ is a *long term* goal; today, there are many, many violations of this principle. (For example,
``case`` can never appear in types, and ``Int -> Bool`` is meaningless in a term.) However, this principle
should direct future proposals not to make the situation worse, and proposals that bring us closer to
the `Syntactic Unification Principle`_ are to be valued.

*Motivation:* The `Syntactic Unification Principle`_ keeps us forward-compatible with a possible future where the
distinction between term-syntax and type-syntax is removed.

From `#378`_.

Explicit Variable Principle (EVP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Explicit Variable Principle`:

**Principle:**
It is possible to write out all (specified) type arguments in every polymorphic function application,
give the type for every bound variable,
and write a type signature for every expression.
This requires the ability to bring type variables into scope.
These variables can be brought into scope without relying on matching or unification.

Examples::

  const :: a -> b -> a
  const x y = ...    -- there must be some way to name the types of x and y here
  -- using `const (x :: a) (y :: b) = ...` is not powerful enough, because it relies
  -- on matching the pattern signature with the argument type from the type signature
  const @a @b x y = ...  -- this version makes it easier to bind `a` and `b`

  data Ex = forall a. Ex a
  f (Ex x) = ...     -- there must be some way to name the type of x here
  f (Ex @a x) = ...  -- this version does it

  hr :: (forall a. a -> a -> a) -> ...
  hr = ...
  g = hr (\ x y -> ...)     -- there must be some way to name the type of x or y here
  g = hf (\ @a x y -> ...)  -- this version bind the variable

The `Explicit Variable Principle`_ does not hold today:

* Even forgetting about the "no matching" restriction, if we have ``hr2 :: (forall a. F a -> Int) -> ...``,
  where ``F`` is a type family,
  there is no way for a function passed to ``hr2`` to locally bind ``a``.

* With the "no matching" restriction,
  if we have ``hr3 :: (forall a. Maybe (Either (Int, Bool, a) Double) -> ...) -> ...``,
  the only way a function passed to ``hr3`` can bind ``a`` is to repeat the type of the argument to that function.

Once we have the `Explicit Variable Principle`_, there will never be a need for ``Proxy``.

*Motivation:*
As GHC supports more and more type-level programming,
the ability to write out type signatures, arguments, and annotations has become increasingly important.
With ``-XScopedTypeVariables``, GHC allows us to bring type variables into scope,
but often requires us to do so by cumbersome matching.
If we have a type ``Maybe (Either (Int, Bool, a) Double)``,
that's a lot to type just to be able to, say, bind ``a``. The EVP says we do *not* have to resort to matching, ever.

From `#448`_.

Visibility Orthogonality Principle (VOP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Visibility Orthogonality Principle`:

**Principle**: Whether an argument is visible or
invisible should affect only its visibility, not other properties.

A consequence of the `Visibility Orthogonality Principle`_ is that these two programs should have the same meaning::

   f1 :: forall a -> ...
   f1 blah1 = ...

   g1 = ... f1 blah2 ...

   -------

   f2 :: forall a. ...
   f2 @(blah1) = ...

   g2 = ... f2 @(blah2) ...

The only difference between these is the visibility.

Put another way: two programs that are the same except for visibility markers (such as
the ``.`` vs ``->`` in a ``forall`` or the presence or absence of a ``@``) should desugar
to the same Core program.

Currently, the design for `#281`_ (along with the design for ``-XTypeApplications``)
violates the `Visibility Orthogonality Principle`_, because the visibility marker ``@`` also affects the difference between
term-syntax and type-syntax. However, given the `Syntactic Unification Principle`_, we strive to uphold the `Visibility Orthogonality Principle`_ when
there is an absence of punning.

*Motivation:* Visibility should be just that: a superficial property that describes
(only) whether an argument is visible in the user-written source code.

Name resolution and scoping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explicit Binding Principle (EBP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Explicit Binding Principle`:

**Principle**:
Through the right combination of extensions,
every implicit form of variable binding must have an explicit equivalent that,
regardless of the context,
is unambiguously a binding site.

Examples:

#. Problem::

     -- Assume no `a` in scope

     id :: a -> a  -- The variable `a` has no explicit binding site.

   Solution::

     -- Assume no `a` in scope

     id :: forall a. a -> a  -- The `a` in `forall a.` is an explicit binding site.

   This is provided by ``-XExplicitForAll``, which predates the GHC proposal process.

#. Problem::

     -- Assume no `a` in scope

     data Foo (a :: k)

   Solution::

     data Foo @k (a :: k)

   This is provided by ``-XTypeAbstractions`` from `#425`_.

#. Problem::

     -- Assume no `b` in scope

     f :: (Bool, Bool) -> Bool
     f (x :: (b, b)) = ...   -- The variable `b` has no implicit binding site.

   We could declare one or both of the ``b`` occurrences above a binding site,
   as was the historical interpretation of this, but that doesn't help as this
   syntax isn't unambiguously a binding site regardless of context (i.e.
   regardless of whether there is a ``b`` already in scope).

*Motivation:*
The `Explicit Binding Principle`_ allows programmers to control exactly how variables come into scope.
It ensures all short-hands can be explained in terms of an explicit, unambiguous equivalent that is easier to understand at the cost of being more verbose:

- Positive-position signatures' free vars cause  implicit ``forall ... .``

- Negative position free vars cause different sorts of binding:

  - Signatures on term patterns (pattern signatures) cause implicit ``let type ... = _ in``

  - Signatures on type variables (kind signatures) cause implicit ``@...``

From `#425`_, `#448`_.

Lexical Scoping Principle (LSP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Lexical Scoping Principle`:

**Principle**:

a. For every appearance of an identifier,
   it is possible to determine whether that appearance is a mere *occurrence*,
   and thus must be bound elsewhere for the program to be valid,
   or the variable is a *binding site* (or causes an implicit binding, which is close enough),
   without examining the context.

b. For every *occurrence* of an identifier,
   it is possible to uniquely identify its *binding site*, without involving the type system.

This builds upon the `Explicit Binding Principle`_:
whereas that former principle ensures that explicit alternatives to implicit binding constructs *exist at all*,
this latter principle makes those explicit alternatives *compulsory*, because we must not have implicit binding in order to uphold this principle.

The `Lexical Scoping Principle`_ is almost true today, with the following nuances:

1. Template Haskell splices may need to be run before completing name resolution (and running those splices requires type-checking them).

2. The `deprecated mechanism <https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/duplicate_record_fields.html#selector-functions>`_ for disambiguating duplicate record fields violates the `Lexical Scoping Principle`_ by requiring the type system.

3. In a pattern signature,
   if we have ``f (x :: Maybe a)``,
   the ``a`` is an occurrence if ``a`` is already in scope,
   and is implicitly bound otherwise.

4. In a type signature,
   if we have ``f :: a -> a``,
   the ``a`` is an occurrence if ``a`` is already in scope,
   and is implicitly bound otherwise.

#. In a kind signature,
   if we have ``data Foo (a :: k)``,
   the ``k`` is an occurrence if ``k`` is already in scope,
   and is implicitly bound otherwise.

*Motivation:*
These principles mean that we can understand the binding structure of a program without relying on type inference,
important both for the implementation of GHC and the sanity of programmers.
Furthermore, it allows readers to identify which variables should be brought newly into scope without tracking the list of variables already in scope.
This last point becomes even more poignant if we consider the possibility of mixing the term-level and type-level namespaces (`#270`_) and need to think about clashes between type variables and imported term variables.

\(a) from `#448`_;
\(b) from `#378`_.

Here is one more recent historical historical example:
Prior to `#425`_, if we had ``type T1 = 'Nothing :: Maybe a``,
the ``a`` was an occurence if ``a`` is already in scope,
and was implicity bound otherwise.
But since `#425`_ it is never implicitly bound.

Contiguous Scoping Principle (CSP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Contiguous Scoping Principle`:

**Principle**: The region of a program for which an identifier
is in scope is contiguous.

The `Contiguous Scoping Principle`_ is *not* respected by Haskell 2010 nor some of GHC's extensions.
Here are some places where it is violated:

1. ``do``\ -notation.
   Example: ``do (x, (f x -> Pat)) <- action; blah``.
   ``x`` is in scope in its pattern, to the right of its binding site, but then not in ``action``.
   It is in scope again in ``blah``.
   Example of potential confusion: ``f x = do x <- x; g x``.

#. List comprehensions.
   Example: ``[ (x, y) | x <- thing1, y <- thing2, condition3 ]``.
   The variable ``y`` is in scope in ``condition3`` and the ``(x, y)`` at the beginning, but nowhere else.
   Example of potential confusion:
   ``f x y = [ (x, y) | x <- y, y <- x ]``.

#. Arrow notation.
   Example: ``proc x -> do y <- task1 -< input1; task2 -< input2``.
   The variable ``x`` is in scope in ``input1`` and ``input2`` but not in ``task1`` or ``task2``.
   Example of potential confusion: ``f x = proc x -> x -< x``.
   The two ``x``\ s at the end refer to *different* variables.

#. ``-XScopedTypeVariables``.
   Example: ``f :: forall a. a -> a; x :: Int; f y = (y :: a)``.
   The type variable ``a`` is in scope in the definition of ``f`` but not in the type signature for ``x``.

#. GADT header variables.
   Example of potential confusion:
   ``data G a where MkG :: a Int -> G Bool deriving C a``.
   The ``a`` in the type of ``MkG`` is completely unrelated to the ``a`` toward the beginning and in the deriving clause.

There may be others beyond this.
The goal here is *not* to establish the `Contiguous Scoping Principle`_, but to be mindful of new violations.

*Motivation:*
The `Contiguous Scoping Principle`_ makes programs easier to read,
in that a reader can add a variable to their internal tracking of in-scope variables then remove that variable from their in-scope set just once.

From `#448`_.

Semantics
~~~~~~~~~

Predictable Erasure Principle (PEP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Predictable Erasure Principle`:

**Principle**: The programmer knows, for sure, which bits of the program will be
retained at runtime, and which will be erased.

The `Predictable Erasure Principle`_ is true today: types are erased, while terms are retained.

From `#378`_.

User experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opt-In Principle (OIP)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _`Opt-In Principle`:

**Principle**: Users who do not opt into an advanced feature will
not be affected by it.

This principle is violated in various ways today: it is easy for GHC to generate error messages that refer to
advanced features even when writing simple code. In addition, the existence of advanced features likely slow
down GHC even when those features are not active. Yet this principle is important to keep in mind going forward,
as we hope not to make the current situation worse.

From `#378`_, slightly generalized.



GHC stability principles
--------------------------

The Haskell ecosystem has a built-in tension between stability and innovation.

One the one hand, breaking changes impose heavy costs:

* Users keep having to update their code
* Library authors keep having to update their code
* Updating to a later version of a library can in turn force taking on new dependencies.

These difficulties add friction, discourage adoption, and make Haskell an unpredictable investment.

On the other hand, GHC has always sought to be a laboratory for innovation.  If the stability guarantees are too onerous, we risk imposing a different set of costs:

* Volunteers may get discouraged by the hoops they have to jump through to get a change agreed.
* The language may become stuck in a local optimum, because moving to a better design would require breaking changes.
* We want Haskell to be a beautiful, elegant language, not one riddled with inconsistencies, grandfathered in simply because fixing the inconsistency would risk some breakage.

We can't navigate this tension with simple all-or-nothing rules.  We have to take each case on its merits, aware of both sets of costs.  This section describes some general rules, or principles, that we use to guide our stability-related discussions for GHC itself.  See also `GHC base library proposal <https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/blob/main/proposals/accepted/051-ghc-base-libraries.rst>`_, which focuses on the stability of the ``base`` library API.


Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We assume that we have identified some extensions as "Experimental".  These extensions may well change, and are subject to much weaker stability goals.  `GHC Proposal #635 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/635>`_ is devoted to agreeing this list.

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We define a **stable Haskell package** as follows. A stable Haskell package

* Explicitly specifies a language edition (``Haskell98``, ``GHC2021``), in the source code or the build configuration.
* Does not use Experimental extensions.
* Does not use experimental features.  (Examples: use of the Javascript or Wasm back end, builds on non-tier-1 platforms.)
* Does not rely on explicitly-undefined behaviour. (Example: ``INCOHERENT`` instance selection.)
* Does not use ``-Werror`` in its default build configuration.
* Does not use ``-dxxx`` debug flags in its default build configuration.

Stability (GR1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our over-arching stability goal is: if it works with GHC(X), it should work with GHC(X+1).  More precisely:

**General rule (GR1)**.  *A stable Haskell package P that works with GHC(X) should continue to work in subsequent releases of GHC, say GHC(X+1),
provided that, for each of P's direct dependencies D,
(a) D works with GHC(X+1), possibly after an update to D, and (b) the API of the bits of D that P uses is unchanged by the update to D.*

In this context the term "API" should be taken to include types, semantics, and performance characteristics.

Consider building one of P's dependencies, say D, with GHC(X+1):

* D may work unchanged with GHC(X+1).
* D may depend on (say) ``ghc-internals``, and require some small change to accomodate the change to ``ghc-internals``, but one that does not require changing D's API; so D will have a minor version bump.
* D may depend on (say) ``ghc-internals``, those changes may force a change to D's API; so D will have a major version bump.

In all three cases, **provided the bits of D's API that P uses are unchanged**, compiling P with GHC(X+1) should work.

Notes and clarifications:

* The general goal of "works" includes both "compiles successfully" and "runs successfully, as fast as it did before".  That is a very demanding goal, so it has the status of a highly-sought-after aspiration rather than an unbreakable promise.

* *Dependencies*.   If a package P depends directly on a package Q that suffers a major version bump to work with the new GHC, then (of course) P may not work with the new Q. A particular case in point is where P depends directly on packages that are tightly coupled to GHC:

  * GHC-internal packages (e.g. ``ghc-internal``, ``ghc-prim``, ``ghc-bignum``) may change API without notice, and may have a major version bump even with minor releases of GHC.
  * The ``ghc`` package currently has a huge API that changes with each minor release of GHC. (There is a separate project to define a more stable GHC API, but that is out of scope for this document.)
  * The ``ghc-experimental`` package will typically expose more functions with each release; and existing functions may change.  It will usually have a major version bump with major releases of GHC, but only a minor version bump with minor releases.
  * The ``template-haskell`` package contains syntax-tree datatypes which need to be changed as the language evolves.  Again, we expect onl a minor version bump with minor release of GHC.
  * Reminder: the package versions of all these GHC packages follow the PVP -- see the `GHC base library proposal <https://github.com/haskellfoundation/tech-proposals/blob/main/proposals/accepted/051-ghc-base-libraries.rst#3things-we-all-agree-about>`_.)

* *The base library* is under the careful management of the Core Libraries Committee. Its API grows slowly, usually requiring a major version bump with each major GHC release.  Since almost every package depends directly on ``base``, it would be highly desirable for a new GHC to be released with version(s) of ``base`` that expose earlier ``base`` APIs (requiring a minor bump only) -- the so-called "reinstallable ``base``" goal.  That is, *``base`` should ideally behave like any other package*.  This is a work in progress.

* *Language editions*.

  * A stable package should specify an explicit language edition because subsequent releases of GHC might change the default language edition.  So if the package does not pin a specific language edition, it might then fail when compiled with a later release.
  * Language editions like ``GHC202x`` should use only stable extensions.

* *Experimental*.  Rule (GR1) applies only to the stable (non-experimental) parts of GHC. The intent is to allow scope for experimentation, while still allowing users to stick to the stable parts of GHC subject to (GR1).

  * We will need to enumerate the "experimental extensions" and "experimental features" mentioned above.
  * As mentioned above, the ``ghc-experimental`` and GHC-internal libraries are likely to have a major version bump (API change) with every major release, so any package that depends directly on these will not be subect to (GR1).

* *Stability of warnings*. There is no stability guarantee that a later GHC will emit the same warnings as an earlier GHC. In particular, rule (GR1) does *not* guarantee that if a package compiles warning-free with one version of GHC, it will still be warning-free with a later version. In general, warnings should not be regarded as stable.

  A notable case in point is deprecations, where a later GHC may advise authors to (say) import a function from a different module; while an earlier GHC obviously will not.  In general, GHC should, by default, warn about upcoming changes so that users can adapt their code at leisure; see (GR3) below.

* ``-Werror``

  * ``-Werror`` is excluded from the definition of a stable package, because otherwise (GR1) would be broken whenever GHC adds new a warning.
  * Similarly ``-Werror=wombat`` is excluded from the definition of a stable package, so that a later GHC make ``-Wwombat`` warn in more cases without breaking (GR1).
  * It's fine for a stable package to use ``-Werror`` in a CI build, to help the author find warnings.  But not in the default configuration, used by others when installing the package.

* *Debug flags*. The behaviour of debug flags ``-dxxx`` (e.g. ``-ddump-simpl``) may vary without warning.  They are for debugging!

* Notice that

  * For new language extensions, (GR1) is trivially satisfied if the change is gated behind an extension flag.
  * (GR1) is certainly broken if, say, we turn a warning into an error.


Exceptions (GR2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**General rule (GR2)**.   *We may break (GR1), but only with a compelling reason, and with careful consideration of impact.*

Compelling reasons include

* To fix a security loophole.
* To fix an outright bug in GHC.  It is possible that some code might accidentally rely on that bug; but we can't use that as a reason to grandfather the bug indefinitely.  (Imagine that 2+77 = 80.)  There is a judgement call here, about what a "bug" is.
* To fix a design flaw in the language. For this, a better path is usually to fix the design flaw with a new language extension, embodied in a new language edition.  Only exceptionally would we fix a design flaw in a way that breaks programs compiled with existing language editions.

This list is not exhaustive, but the emphasis is on "compelling reason", bearing in mind the costs that any change imposes on users.

Choices should be informed by the amount of breakage, e.g. by compiling thousands of packages in Hackage.  Changes that break little or nothing need a much less compelling reason than changes that break a lot.  For example, changing the meaning of the ``LambdaCase`` extensions to include ``\cases`` as well as ``\case`` would break a program that used ``cases`` as a lambda-bound variable.  But we judged that this risk was small compared to the bureaucratic overhead of having two extensions.

Choices can occasionally also be influenced by implementation considerations. If, for example, a major (and desirable) refactoring of the type inference engine changes the behavior of some under-specified edge cases (of which GHC's type system has plenty), it would be unreasonable to attempt to keep the old and the new behaviour.

Changes, especially significant changes, should be introduced gradually: the subject of (GR3).


Warning of upcoming changes (GR3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**General rule (GR3)**.  *If we break (GR1), for a compelling reason (GR2), we should whenever possible provide a deprecation cycle, as well as appropriate publicity, so that users are alerted (via warnings) of the upcoming change, have time to adapt, and can raise concerns.*

"Provide a deprecation cycle" means that (if possible) when a change in GHC will break existing code,
then

* GHC(N) should *warn* of the upcoming change, and only GHC(N+1) should make the breaking change
* The library author can adapt their code in such a way that it works in *both* GHC(N) *and* GHC(N+1)

This gives at least one GHC major release for authors to make changes.  In the case of changes that are more difficult to accommodate, we may consider a second cycle.

Note that (GR3) is not a reason to say that (GR1) is unimportant.  A deprecation cycle defers costs; it does not reduce or eliminate them. However, deprecation cycles are very important.  They give users and library authors time to adapt to changes, without a mad panic.  In particular, they allow users to upgrade GHC (e.g. to get an important bugfix) in one step, and then separately, and on a working code base, to adapt to each change individually, instead of having to do it all in one atomic step.

Notes:

* It may not be possible to satisfy (GR3).  A notable example is that of module exports.  Suppose (say) in GHC(N) an export ``foo`` is added to a module ``M``.  Then, in a module ``X``, if that new import of ``foo`` from ``M`` import clashes with some existing definition or import of ``foo``, compilation will break.  The code can be adapted in a backward-compatible way (e.g. by hiding ``foo`` or importing ``M`` qualified), but immediate action must be taken to make the ``M`` compile with GHC(N).
* Even changes to Experimental extensions should seek to follow (GR3), but with a significantly lower "bar".
* There is a `separate conversation going on <https://github.com/haskell/pvp/issues/58>`_ about deprecation warnings and the PVP.
* (GR3) is not the same as a **three-release policy**.  GHC does not currently have a three-release policy; that is a `separate debate <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/issues/629>`_.


Mechanisms for checking stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having crisper definitions opens up the possibility of also providing mechanical support, through which a user can declare their intent to use only stable packages.  This is the subject
of `GHC Proposal #617 <https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/617>`_.
